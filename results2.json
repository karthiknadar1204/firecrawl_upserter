It is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of data within the same local network. Its major role is to ensure error-free transmission of information. DLL is also responsible for encoding, decoding, and organizing the outgoing and incoming data.\n\nThis is considered the most complex layer of the OSI model as it hides all the underlying complexities of the hardware from the other above layers.\u00a0In this article, we will discuss Data Link Layer in Detail along with its functions, and sub-layers.\n\n![30](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128105440836652/30.webp)\n\nData Link Layer in OSI Model\n\n## Sub-Layers of The Data Link Layer\n\nThe data link layer is further divided into two sub-layers, which are as follows:\n\n### Logical Link Control (LLC)\n\nThis sublayer of the data link layer deals with multiplexing, the flow of data among applications and other services, and LLC is responsible for providing error messages and acknowledgments as well.\n\n### Media Access Control (MAC)\n\nMAC sublayer manages the device\u2019s interaction, responsible for addressing frames, and also controls physical media access. The data link layer receives the information in the form of packets from the Network layer, it divides packets into frames and sends those frames bit-by-bit to the underlying physical layer.\n\n## Functions of The Data-link Layer\n\nThere are various benefits of data link layers s let\u2019s look into it.\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128105254285850/functions_of_data_link_layer.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128105254285850/functions_of_data_link_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162341626693/functions_of_data_link_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162341626693/functions_of_data_link_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162341817996/functions_of_data_link_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162341817996/functions_of_data_link_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123164203841611/functions_of_data_link_layer_5.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123164203841611/functions_of_data_link_layer_5.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342261043/functions_of_data_link_layer_6.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342261043/functions_of_data_link_layer_6.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342455840/functions_of_data_link_layer_7.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342455840/functions_of_data_link_layer_7.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342652878/functions_of_data_link_layer_8.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342652878/functions_of_data_link_layer_8.webp)\n\n![functions_of_data_link_layer_9.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342845770/functions_of_data_link_layer_9.webp)![functions_of_data_link_layer_9.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250123162342845770/functions_of_data_link_layer_9.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 8\n\nTo read in detail about services offered by this layer, refer to [Data Link Layer Services](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer-services).\n\n## Protocols in Data link layer\n\nThere are various [protocols in the data link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/examples-of-data-link-layer-protocols), which are as follows:\n\n- [Synchronous Data Link Protocol (SDLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-frame-structure-of-sdlc)\n- [High-Level Data Link Protocol (HDLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-frame-structure-of-hdlc)\n- [Serial Line Interface Protocol (SLIP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slip-full-form)\n- [Point to Point Protocol (PPP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/point-to-point-protocol-ppp-encapsulation)\n- [Link Access Procedure (LAP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-access-procedure-lap-protocols)\n- Link Control Protocol (LCP)\n- [Network Control Protocol (NCP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-control-protocol-ncp/)\n\n## Devices Operating at the Data Link Layer\n\n### **1.Switch**\n\n- A switch is a key device in the Data Link Layer.\n- It uses **MAC addresses** to forward data frames to the correct device within a network.\n- Works in **local area networks (LANs)** to connect multiple devices.\n\n### **2\\. Bridge**\n\n- A bridge connects two or more LANs, creating a single, unified network.\n- Operates at the Data Link Layer by forwarding frames based on **MAC addresses**.\n- Used to reduce network traffic and segment a network.\n\n### **3\\. Network Interface Card (NIC)**\n\n- A NIC is a hardware component in devices like computers and printers.\n- Responsible for adding the **MAC address** to frames and ensuring proper communication with the network.\n- Operates at the Data Link Layer by preparing and sending frames over the physical medium.\n\n### **4\\. Wireless Access Point (WAP)**\n\n- A WAP allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.\n- Operates at the Data Link Layer by managing **wireless MAC addresses**.\n- Uses protocols like Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) to communicate with devices.\n\n### **5\\. Layer 2 Switches**\n\n- These are specialized switches that only operate at Layer 2, unlike multi-layer switches.\n- Responsible for **frame forwarding** using MAC address tables.\n\n## **Limitations of Data Link Layer**\n\n- **Limited Scope**: It operates only within a local network and cannot handle end-to-end communication across different networks.\n- **Increased Overhead**: Adding headers, trailers, and redundant data (for error correction) increases the size of transmitted data.\n- **Error Handling Dependency**: While it can detect and correct some errors, it relies on upper layers for handling more complex issues.\n- **No Routing Capability**: The Data Link Layer cannot make routing decisions. It only ensures delivery within the same network segment.\n- **Resource Usage**: Flow control and error correction mechanisms may consume extra processing power and memory\n\n## Applications of Data Link Layer\n\n- **Local Area Networks (LANs)**: Enables reliable communication between devices within a local network using protocols like Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).\n- **Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi)**: Manages communication between devices in wireless networks via protocols like IEEE 802.11 hence, handling media access and error control.\n- **Switches and MAC Addressing**: Facilitates the operation of switches by using MAC addresses to forward data frames to the correct device within the network.\n- **Point-to-Point Connections**: Used in protocols like PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) to establish and manage direct communication between two nodes.\n\nBelow questions have been asked in previous GATE exam on above topic:\n\n[GATE \\| GATE-CS-2003 \\| Question 90](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2003-question-68/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE-CS-2005 \\| Question 74](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2005-question-74/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2013 \\| Question 65](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2013-question-36/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2015 Set 3 \\| Question 65](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2015-set-3-question-16/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE-CS-2007 \\| Question\u00a068](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2007-question-68/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2009 \\| Question\u00a048](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2009-question-48/)\n\n**For practice, solve** [**quiz on Data Link Layer**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quizzes/data-link-layer-gq/?page=10) **.**\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Data Link Layer \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the purpose of framing in the Data Link Layer?\n\n> Framing involves encapsulating data into frames with headers and trailers, allowing the receiver to identify the start and end of each frame and to distinguish between different frames.\n\n### What is MAC address in the Data Link Layer?\n\n> MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware address assigned to network interfaces at the Data Link Layer.

A computer user experiences switching all the time for example, accessing the Internet from your computer device, whenever a user requests a webpage to open, the request is processed through switching of data packets only.\n\nSwitching takes place at the Data Link layer of the OSI Model. This means that after the generation of data packets in the Physical Layer, switching is the immediate next process in data communication.\n\n## Introduction to Switch\n\n- A switch is a hardware device in a network that connects and helps multiple devices share a network without their data interfering with each other.\n- A switch works like a traffic cop at a busy intersection. When a data packet arrives, the switch decides where it needs to go and sends it through the right port.\n- Some data packets come from devices directly connected to the switch, like computers or VoIP phones. Other packets come from devices connected through hubs or routers.\n- The switch knows which devices are connected to it and can send data directly between them. If the data needs to go to another network, the switch sends it to a router, which forwards it to the correct destination.\n\n## What is Network Switching?\n\nA switch is a dedicated piece of computer hardware that facilitates the process of switching i.e., incoming data packets and transferring them to their destination. A switch works at the [Data Link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/) of the [OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/). A switch primarily handles the incoming data packets from a source computer or network and decides the appropriate port through which the data packets will reach their target computer or network.\n\nA switch decides the port through which a data packet shall pass with the help of its destination [MAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mac-address-in-computer-network/)(Media Access Control) Address. A switch does this effectively by maintaining a switching table, (also known as forwarding table). A network switch is more efficient than a network Hub or repeater because it maintains a switching table, which simplifies its task and reduces congestion on a network, which effectively improves the performance of the network.\n\n![working of network switch](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230519121809/Network-Switch-01.webp)\n\nThe switching process involves the following steps:\n\n- **Frame Reception:** The switch receives a data frame or [packet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-packet-sniffing/) from a computer connected to its ports.\n- **MAC Address Extraction:** The switch reads the header of the [data frame](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe/) and collects the destination [MAC Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mac-address-in-computer-network/) from it.\n- **MAC Address Table Lookup:** Once the switch has retrieved the MAC Address, it performs a lookup in its [Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-cut-through-switching/) table to find a port that leads to the MAC Address of the data frame.\n- **Forwarding Decision and Switching Table Update:** If the switch matches the destination MAC Address of the frame to the MAC address in its switching table, it forwards the data frame to the respective port. However, if the destination MAC Address does not exist in its forwarding table, it follows the [flooding process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-mac-flooding/), in which it sends the data frame to all its ports except the one it came from and records all the MAC Addresses to which the frame was delivered. This way, the switch finds the new MAC Address and updates its [forwarding table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-ip-forwarding-table-lookup/).\n- **Frame Transition:** Once the destination port is found, the switch sends the data frame to that port and forwards it to its target computer/network.\n\n## Types of Switching\n\nThere are three types of switching methods:\n\n- [Message Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/message-switching-techniques/)\n- [Circuit Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/circuit-switching-in-computer-network/)\n- [Packet Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-message-and-packet-switching/)\n  - Datagram Packet Switching\n  - Virtual Circuit Packet Switching\n\n![Types-of-switching.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230522105035/Types-of-switching.png)\n\nLet us now discuss them individually:\n\n**Message Switching:** This is an older switching technique that has become obsolete. In message switching technique, the entire data block/message is forwarded across the entire [network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/) thus, making it highly inefficient.\n\n![Message-swithcing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250204171616348681/Message-swithcing.webp)\n\nMessage Switching\n\n**Circuit Switching:** In this type of switching, a connection is established between the source and destination beforehand. This connection receives the complete bandwidth of the network until the data is transferred completely.\n\nThis approach is better than [message switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/message-switching-techniques/) as it does not involve sending data to the entire network, instead of its destination only.\n\n![Circuit-Switching](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250204173116134261/Circuit-Switching.webp)\n\nCircuit Switching\n\n**Packet Switching:** This technique requires the data to be broken down into smaller components, data frames, or [packets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/steps-of-finding-packets-in-wireshark/). These [data frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-data-frames/) are then transferred to their destinations according to the available resources in the network at a particular time.\n\nThis switching type is used in modern computers and even the Internet. Here, each data frame contains additional information about the destination and other information required for proper transfer through network components.\n\n![4514-660](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250204173353466835/4514-660.png)\n\nPacket Switching\n\n**Datagram Packet Switching:** In Datagram Packet switching, each data frame is taken as an individual entity and thus, they are processed separately. Here, no connection is established before data transmission occurs. Although this approach provides flexibility in data transfer, it may cause a loss of data frames or late delivery of the data frames.\n\n**Virtual-Circuit Packet Switching:** In Virtual-Circuit Packet switching, a logical connection between the source and destination is made before transmitting any data. These logical connections are called [virtual circuits](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-circuit-in-computer-network/). Each data frame follows these logical paths and provides a reliable way of transmitting data with less chance of data loss.\n\nRead about [Difference between Datagram Switching and Virtual Circuit Switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-datagram-switching-virtual-circuit/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Switching \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Why switching is used?\n\n> The purpose of switching is to connect all the devices on a network without needing a separate connection between each pair of devices. Switching technology helps create these connections when needed.\n\n### How is a switch different from a router?\n\n> A switch connects devices within a local-area network (LAN) by using MAC addresses to know where to send data packets. A router connects LANs to other networks or to the internet and uses IP addresses to route data packets to their destinations.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-cut-through-switching/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Cut-through Switching?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-cut-through-switching/?ref=next_article)\n\n[O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/owl0223/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[owl0223](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/owl0223/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n14\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Switching?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nSwitching is the process of transferring data packets from one device to another in a network, or from one network to another, using specific devices called switches.

In message switching the entire message is transmitted without any break from one node to another. There is no direct link present between the sender and the receiver in message switching.\n\n## **What is Message Switching?**\n\nMessage switching is a switching mechanism in which a message is sent as a single unit and routed to intermediary nodes where it is stored and forwarded. The message-switching approach does not provide a dedicated path between the sender and receiver. In message switching, end-users communicate by sending and receiving _messages_ that include the entire data to be shared. Messages are the smallest individual unit.\u00a0Also, the sender and receiver are not directly connected. Several intermediate nodes transfer data and ensure that the message reaches its destination. [Message-switched](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/videos/message-switching-in-computer-network/) data networks are hence called hop-by-hop systems.\n\n![Message-swithcing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240425133145/Message-swithcing.webp)\n\nMessage Switching\n\n- **Store and forward \u2013** The intermediate nodes have the responsibility of transferring the entire message to the next node. Hence, each node must have storage capacity. A message will only be delivered if the next hop and the link connecting it are both available, otherwise, it\u2019ll be stored indefinitely. A store-and-forward switch forwards a message only if sufficient resources are available and the next hop is accepting data. This is called the store-and-forward property.\n- **Message delivery \u2013** This implies wrapping the entire information in a single message and transferring it from the source to the destination node. Each message must have a header that contains the message routing information, including the source and destination.\n\nMessage switching network consists of [transmission links (channels),](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-transmission-media/) store-and-forward switch nodes, and end stations as shown in the following picture:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Capture-144.png)\n\n## **Advantages of Message Switching**\n\n- As message switching is able to store the message for which communication channel is not available, it helps in reducing the traffic congestion in the network.\n- In message switching, the data channels are shared by the [network devices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/).\n- It makes traffic management efficient by assigning priorities to the messages.\n- Because the messages are delivered via a store and forward method, it is possible to include priority in them.\n- It allows for infinite message lengths.\n- Unlike circuit switching, it does not necessitate the actual connection of source and destination devices.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Message Switching**\n\n- Message switching cannot be used for real-time applications as storing messages causes [delay](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delays-in-computer-network/).\n- In message switching, the message has to be stored for which every intermediate device in the network requires a large storing capacity.\n- Because the system is so intricate, people are frequently unaware of whether or not messages are correctly conveyed. This could cause problems in social relationships.\n- The type of message switching does not create a dedicated path between the devices. It is not dependable communication because there is no direct relationship between sender and receiver.\n\n## **Applications of Message Switching**\n\nThe store-and-forward method was implemented in telegraph message switching centres. Today, although many major networks and systems are packet-switched or circuit-switched networks, their delivery processes can be based on message switching. For example, in most electronic mail systems the delivery process is based on message switching, while the network is in fact either circuit-switched or packet-switched.\n\n## Difference Between Message Switching and Packet Switching\n\n| Message Switching | Packet Switching |\n| --- | --- |\n| In [message switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-message-and-packet-switching/) the complete message is passed across a network. | In [packet switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/) the entire message is broken into smaller units known as Packets. |\n| In this, computer language used is ASCII, baudot, morse. | In packet switching, binary type is used. |\n| Message exist only in one location in the network. | Packets of the message exist in many places in the network. |\n| Access time is reduced due to increase in performance as packets are stored in disk. | Packets are stored in main memory. |\n| In message switching there is no limit on block size. | Packet switching places a tight upper limit on block size. |\n| Physical links are allocated dynamically. | Virtual links are made simultaneously. |\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Message Switching \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Where is message switching used?\n\n> Military networks, ad hoc sensor networks, and satellite communications uses message switching technology.\n\n### What moves messages between networks?\n\n> Routers work at the network layer of the OSI model, efficiently transmitting data between local area networks.\n\n### **What is the role of addressing in message switching?**\n\n> Addressing is critical in message switching since it determines the path a message goes throughout the network.\n\n### **How does message switching ensure message delivery?**\n\n> Message switching often uses error detection and correction techniques to assure message delivery.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Packet Switching and Delays in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/me_l/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[me\\_l](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/me_l/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n37\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

This connection receives the complete bandwidth of the network until the data is transferred completely. However, circuit switching can be inefficient and costly due to its requirement for dedicated resources, making it less suitable for high-traffic or large-scale networks. In this article, we will discuss every point about Circuit Switching.\n\n## What is Circuit Switching?\n\nIn circuit switching network resources ( [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/)) are divided into pieces and the bit delay is constant during a connection. The dedicated path/circuit established between the sender and receiver provides a guaranteed data rate. Data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established.\n\n![Circuit-Switching](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240424165529/Circuit-Switching.webp)\n\nThe telephone system network is one of the examples of Circuit switching. **FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing)** and **TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)** are two methods of multiplexing multiple signals into a single carrier.\n\n- **Frequency Division Multiplexing:** [Frequency Division Multiplexing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frequency-division-and-time-division-multiplexing/) or FDM is used when multiple data signals are combined for simultaneous transmission via a shared communication medium. It is a technique by which the total bandwidth is divided into a series of non-overlapping frequency sub-bands, where each sub-band carries different signal. Practical use in radio spectrum & optical fiber to share multiple independent signals.\n- **Time Division Multiplexing:** [Time-division multiplexing (TDM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-tdm-and-fdm/) is a method of transmitting and receiving independent signals over a common signal path using synchronized switches at each end of the transmission line. TDM is used for long-distance communication links and bears heavy data traffic loads from the end user.\u00a0Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is also known as a digital circuit switch.\n\n## Phases of Circuit Switching\n\n- **Circuit Establishment:** A dedicated circuit between the source and destination is constructed via a number of intermediary switching center\u2019s. Communication signals can be requested and received when the sender and receiver communicate signals over the circuit.\n- **Data Transfer:** Data can be transferred between the source and destination once the circuit has been established. The link between the two parties remains as long as they communicate.\n- **Circuit Disconnection:** Disconnection in the circuit occurs when one of the users initiates the disconnect. When the disconnection occurs, all intermediary linkages between the sender and receiver are terminated.\n\n![Phases of Circuit Switching](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240906152427/Circuit-Switching.gif)\n\n## What is Circuit Switching Used For?\n\n- **Continuous connections:** Circuit switching is used for connections that must be maintained for long periods, such as long-distance communication. Circuit switching technology is used in traditional telephone systems.\n- **Dial-up network connections:** When a computer connects to the internet through a dial-up service, it uses the public switched network. Dial-up transmits [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-internet-protocols/) data packets via a circuit-switched telephone network.\n- **Optical circuit switching:** Data centre networks also make use of circuit switching. Optical circuit switching is used to expand traditional data centres and fulfil increasing bandwidth demands.\n\n## **Advantages of Circuit Switching**\n\n- The main advantage of circuit switching is that a committed transmission channel is established between the computers which give a guaranteed data rate.\n- In circuit switching, there is no delay in data flow because of the dedicated transmission path.\n- **Reliability:** Circuit switching provides a high level of reliability since the dedicated communication path is reserved for the entire duration of the communication. This ensures that the data will be transmitted without any loss or corruption.\n- **Quality of service:** Circuit switching provides a guaranteed quality of service, which means that the network can prioritize certain types of traffic, such as voice and video, over other types of traffic, such as email and web browsing.\n- **Security:** Circuit switching provides a higher level of security compared to packet switching since the dedicated communication path is only accessible to the two communicating parties. This can help prevent unauthorized access and [data breaches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-breach/).\n- **Ease of management:** Circuit switching is relatively easy to manage since the communication path is pre-established and dedicated to a specific communication. This can help simplify network management and reduce the risk of errors.\n- **Compatibility:** Circuit switching is compatible with a wide range of devices and protocols, which means that it can be used with different types of networks and applications. This makes it a versatile technology for various industries and use cases.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Circuit Switching**\n\n- **Limited scalability:** Circuit switching is not well-suited for large-scale networks with many nodes, as it requires a dedicated communication path between each pair of nodes. This can result in a high degree of complexity and difficulty in managing the network.\n- **Vulnerability to failures:** Circuit switching relies on a dedicated communication path, which can make the network vulnerable to failures, such as cable cuts or switch failures. In the event of a failure, the communication path must be re-established, which can result in delays or loss of data.\n- **Limited Flexibility:** Circuit switching is not flexible as it requires a dedicated circuit between the communicating devices. The circuit cannot be used Waste of Resources for any other purpose until the communication is complete, which limits the flexibility of the network.\n- **Waste of Resources:** Circuit switching reserves the bandwidth and network resources for the duration of the communication, even if there is no data being transmitted. This results in the wastage of resources and inefficient use of the network.\n- **Expensive:** Circuit switching is an expensive technology as it requires dedicated communication paths, which can be costly to set up and maintain. This makes it less feasible for small-scale networks and applications.\n- **Susceptible to Failure:** Circuit switching is susceptible to failure as it relies on a dedicated communication path. If the path fails, the entire communication is disrupted. This makes it less reliable than other networking technologies, such as [packet switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/).\n- **Not suitable for high traffic:** Circuit switching is not suitable for high traffic, where data is transmitted intermittently at irregular intervals. This is because a dedicated circuit needs to be established for each communication, which can result in delays and inefficient use of resources.\n- **Delay and latency:** Circuit switching requires the establishment of a dedicated communication path, which can result in delay and [latency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-latency/) in establishing the path and transmitting data. This can impact the real-time performance of applications, such as voice and video.\n- **High cost:** Circuit switching requires the reservation of resources, which can result in a high cost, particularly in large-scale networks. This can make circuit switching less practical for some applications.\n- **No prioritization:** Circuit switching does not provide any mechanism for prioritizing certain types of traffic over others.\n\n## Difference between Circuit Switching and Packet Switching\n\n| Circuit Switching | Packet Switching |\n| --- | --- |\n| In-circuit switching, each data unit knows the entire path address which is provided by the source. | In Packet switching, each data unit just knows the final destination address intermediate path is decided by the routers. |\n| In-Circuit switching, data is processed at the source system only | In Packet switching, data is processed at all intermediate nodes including the source system. |\n| The delay between data units in circuit switching is uniform. | The delay between data units in packet switching is not uniform. |\n| Circuit switching is more reliable. | Packet switching is less reliable. |\n| Wastage of resources is more in Circuit Switching | Less wastage of resources as compared to Circuit Switching |\n| Circuit switching is not convenient for handling bilateral traffic. | Packet switching is suitable for handling bilateral traffic. |\n| In-Circuit Switching there is a physical path between the source and the destination | In Packet Switching there is no physical path between the source and the destination |\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nTraditional telecommunications systems and landlines rely on circuit switching for their functioning. Packet switching is the foundation of the modern Internet. Each has both advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes they overlap, like when a packet-switching\u00a0network emulates circuit-switching technology and establishes a connection-oriented manner of data transport. The internet and most phone services now rely on packet switching. However, most legacy networks were intended to handle circuit-switched traffic. A new optical routing architecture could help overcome this gap.\n\n## Formulas Used in Circuit Switching\n\n```\nTransmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate /\n            no. of slots = R/h bps\nTransmission time = size of file / transmission rate\n                                 = x / (R/h)\n                                 = (x*h)/R second\nTotal time to send packet to destination = Transmission time + circuit setup time\n```\n\n## **Question for Practice based on Circuit switching**\n\n**Question 1 :** How long it takes to send a file of \u2018x bits\u2019 from host A to host B over a circuit switched network that uses TDM with \u2018h slots\u2019 and have a bit rate of \u2018R Mbps\u2019, circuit establish time is k seconds. Find total time?\n\n> - Transmission rate = Link Rate or Bit rate / no. of slots = R/h bps\n> - Transmission time = size of file/ transmission rate = x / (R/h) = (x\\*h)/R\n> - Total time = transmission time + circuit setup time = (x\\*h)/R secs + k secs\n\n**Question 2 :** If a link transmits F frames/sec and each slot has B bits then find the transmission rate?\n\n> Since it is not mention how many slots in each frame we take one frame has one slot.\n>\n> The transmission rate is the amount of data sent in 1 second.\n>\n> Transmission rate = F \\* B bits/sec\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBefore data transfer, circuit switching provides a dedicated connection between the source and destination, ensuring a consistent data flow with minimal latency. While it provides great dependability and service quality, its resource-intensive nature and higher prices make it inappropriate for high-traffic or large-scale networks. Packet switching, on the other hand, is more adaptable and resource-efficient, making it ideal for dealing with irregular traffic patterns.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Circuit Switching \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **How does circuit switching work?**\n\n> A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver nodes through the network. This path typically involves reserving resources (such as bandwidth) along each intermediate node to accommodate the communication session. Once the circuit is established, data is transmitted directly along the dedicated path without routing decisions.\n\n### **What types of communication are typically handled using circuit switching?**\n\n> Circuit switching is commonly used for real-time, continuous communication such as voice calls, video conferencing, and live streaming\n\n### **What is the role of signaling in circuit switching?**\n\n> Signaling is used to coordinate call setup, teardown, and other control functions in circuit-switched networks.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/message-switching-techniques/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Message switching techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/message-switching-techniques/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

A Message Switching transmits the entire message as a single unit through a intermediate nodes using store and forward technique where each node must receive the complete message before forwarding it. A Packet Switching divides a messages into the smaller packets that are sent independently through the different network paths and reassembled at a destination. While the Message Switching requires a more storage and can cause the delays. Packet Switching offers a efficient resource utilization and forms the basis of a modern internet communications.\n\n## What is Message Switching?\n\nIn this technique the entire message is transmitted without any break from one node to another. It firstly stores and then forwards information that requires more time. Due to this, the access time is increased. No direct link is present between the sender and the receiver.\n\n![Message-Switching](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241029170023110257/Message-Switching.png)\n\n### Advantages of Message\n\n- Messaging allows for a quick and a convenient communication enabling the people to stay connected regardless of distance or time zones. It provides written record of a conversations which can be useful for a reference or documentation purposes.\n\n- Messaging platforms support the multimedia sharing allowing users to easily exchange the photos, videos and files. This versatility enhances the richness of a communication and facilitates collaboration in the both personal and professional settings.\n\n- Messaging offers less intrusive form of a communication compared to the phone calls allowing recipients to respond at convenience. It also provides the options for group conversations making it easier to coordinate with a multiple people at same time.\n\n### Disadvantages of Message\n\n- The instantaneous nature of a messaging can create the pressure for immediate responses leading to stress and a constant interruptions. This can negatively impact the productivity and personal time blurring the lines between a work and leisure.\n\n- Messaging lacks the variation of face-to-face communication such as a tone of voice and body language which can lead to the misunderstandings. This limitation can sometimes result in a miscommunication or misinterpretation of the sender intent.\n\n- Excessive reliance on a messaging can reduce in person interactions and potentially impact the development of a social skills. It may also contribute to sense of disconnection or isolation despite the increase in communication frequency.\n\n## What is Packet Switching?\n\nThe packet switching information is transferred in the form of a data packets between the sender and the receiver. These packets are forwarded one by one from a sender to a receiver. Each packet is associated with a Header. Then, these packets then reassembled into the original message. This improves the performance as the time require to access the data packet is reduced. Due to this, the overall performance of the network is improved.\n\n![Packet-Switching](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241029165933712408/Packet-Switching.png)\n\n### Advantages of Packet Switching\n\n- Efficient use of network resources as multiple users can share the same communication lines simultaneously. This leads to better utilization of available bandwidth and reduced costs.\n\n- Improved reliability through dynamic routing, allowing data to find alternative paths if one route is congested or fails. This enhances network resilience and ensures data delivery even in partial network failures.\n\n- Flexibility in handling various types of data and traffic patterns. Packet switching can easily accommodate different data types and varying loads, making it adaptable to diverse network requirements.\n\n### Disadvantages of Packet Switching\n\n- Potential for packet loss or out-of-order delivery, requiring additional protocols for error checking and sequencing. This can lead to increased complexity in network management and potential data integrity issues.\n\n- Variable latency due to different routing paths and network conditions, which can affect real-time applications. This unpredictability can be problematic for time-sensitive services like voice or video communications.\n\n- Overhead from packet headers and routing information, reducing the effective data transmission rate. Each packet carries extra information for routing and reassembly, which consumes some of the available bandwidth.\n\n## **Difference between Message and Packet Switching**\n\n| Message Switching | Packet Switching |\n| --- | --- |\n| A complete message is passed across a network. | Message is broken into smaller units known as Packets. |\n| In this, computer language used is ASCII, baudot, morse. | In packet switching, binary type is used. |\n| In message switching there is no limit on block size. | Packet switching places a tight upper limit on block size. |\n| Message exist only in one location in the network. | Parts i.e. packets of the message exist in many places in the network. |\n| Example: Hop-by-hop Telex forwarding and UUCP(UNIX-to-UNIX Copy Protocol) | Example: Frame Relay, IP, and X. 25 |\n| Physical links are allocated dynamically. | Virtual links are made simultaneously. |\n| Access time is reduced due to increase in performance as packets are stored in disk. | Packets are stored in main memory. |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMessage switching and packet switching are two ways to send data across networks. Message switching sends entire messages as one unit, like a complete letter. Packet switching breaks data into smaller packets, sending each separately, like mailing a letter in pieces. Packet switching is more efficient and flexible, allowing better use of network resources. It\u2019s the basis for how the internet works, while message switching is mostly obsolete for data communications. Think of message switching as sending a postcard, and packet switching as sending a series of text messages.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Message and Packet Switching \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### Which method is more efficient?\n\n> A Packet switching is efficient. It allows the network resources to be shared better as small packets from a different sources can be interwoven on the same lines reducing wait times and making it better use of a available bandwidth.\n\n### Give the real world analogy for the message and packet switching?\n\n> A Message switching means sending a complete postcard through a mail. The Packet switching is more like sending the series of a text messages where each message can take its own route to reach the recipient quickly.\n\n### Which method is used for a internet?\n\n> The internet uses a packet switching. This allows fast & more flexible data transmission enabling the quick loading of a web pages and smooth video streaming and rapid file downloads.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-circuit-switching-and-message-switching/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Difference between Circuit switching and Message switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-circuit-switching-and-message-switching/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Difference Between](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/difference-between/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Difference between Message and Packet Switching\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Message and the Packet Switching are a two fundamental methods of the data transmission in a computer networks.

Generally, layer 3 devices divide the broadcast domain but the broadcast domain can be divided by switches using the concept of VLAN.\n\nA broadcast domain is a network segment in which if a device broadcast a packet then all the devices in the same broadcast domain will receive it. The devices in the same broadcast domain will receive all the broadcast packets but it is limited to switches only as routers don\u2019t forward out the broadcast packet. To forward out the packets to different VLAN (from one VLAN to another) or broadcast domains, inter Vlan routing is needed. Through VLAN, different small-size sub-networks are created which are comparatively easy to handle.\n\n**VLAN ranges:**\n\n- **VLAN 0, 4095:** These are reserved VLAN which cannot be seen or used.\n- **VLAN 1:** It is the default VLAN of switches. By default, all switch ports are in VLAN. This VLAN can\u2019t be deleted or edit but can be used.\n- **VLAN 2-1001:** This is a normal VLAN range. We can create, edit and delete these VLAN.\n- **VLAN 1002-1005:** These are CISCO defaults for fddi and token rings. These VLAN can\u2019t be deleted.\n- **Vlan 1006-4094:** This is the extended range of Vlan.\n\n**Configuration \u2013**\n\nWe can simply create VLANs by simply assigning the vlan-id and Vlan name.\n\n```\n#switch1(config)#vlan 2\n#switch1(config-vlan)#vlan accounts\n```\n\nHere, 2 is the Vlan I\u2019d and accounts is the Vlan name. Now, we assign Vlan to the switch ports.e.g-\n\n```\nSwitch(config)#int fa0/0\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport mode access\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport access Vlan 2\n```\n\nAlso, switchport range can be assigned to required vlans.\n\n```\nSwitch(config)#int range fa0/0-2\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport mode access\nSwitch(config-if) #switchport access Vlan 2\n```\n\nBy this, switchport fa0/0, fa0/1, fa0-2 will be assigned Vlan 2.\n\n**Example \u2013**\n\n![52555](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/52555.png)\n\nAssigning IP address 192.168.1.1/24, 192.168.1.2/24 and 192.168.2.1/24 to the PC\u2019s. Now, we will create Vlan 2 and 3 on switch.\n\n```\nSwitch(config)#vlan 2\nSwitch(config)#vlan 3\n```\n\nWe have made VLANs but the most important part is to assign switch ports to the VLANs.\n\n```\nSwitch(config)#int fa0/0\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport mode access\nSwitch(config-if) #switchport access Vlan 2\n\nSwitch(config)#int fa0/1\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport mode access\nSwitch(config-if) #switchport access Vlan 3\n\nSwitch(config)#int fa0/2\nSwitch(config-if)#switchport mode access\nSwitch(config-if) #switchport access Vlan 2\n```\n\nAs seen, we have assigned Vlan 2 to fa0/0, fa0/2, and Vlan 3 to fa0/1.\n\n### VLANs offer several features and benefits, including:\n\n- **Improved network security:** VLANs can be used to separate network traffic and limit access to specific network resources. This improves security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and network resources.\n- **Better network performance:** By segregating network traffic into smaller logical networks, VLANs can reduce the amount of broadcast traffic and improve network performance.\n- **Simplified network management:** VLANs allow network administrators to group devices together logically, rather than physically, which can simplify network management tasks such as configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance.\n- **Flexibility:** VLANs can be configured dynamically, allowing network administrators to quickly and easily adjust network configurations as needed.\n- **Cost savings:** VLANs can help reduce hardware costs by allowing multiple virtual networks to share a single physical network infrastructure.\n- **Scalability:** VLANs can be used to segment a network into smaller, more manageable groups as the network grows in size and complexity.\n\n### Some of the key features of VLANs include:\n\n- **VLAN tagging:** VLAN tagging is a way to identify and distinguish VLAN traffic from other network traffic. This is typically done by adding a VLAN tag to the Ethernet frame header.\n- **VLAN membership:** VLAN membership determines which devices are assigned to which VLANs. Devices can be assigned to VLANs based on port, MAC address, or other criteria.\n- **VLAN trunking:** VLAN trunking allows multiple VLANs to be carried over a single physical link. This is typically done using a protocol such as IEEE 802.1Q.\n- **VLAN management:** VLAN management involves configuring and managing VLANs, including assigning devices to VLANs, configuring VLAN tags, and configuring VLAN trunking.\n\n**Types of connections in VLAN \u2013**\n\nThere are three ways to connect devices on a VLAN, the type of connections are based on the connected devices i.e. whether they are VLAN-aware(A device that understands VLAN formats and VLAN membership) or VLAN-unaware(A device that doesn\u2019t understand VLAN format and VLAN membership).\n\n1. **Trunk Link \u2013**\n\nAll connected devices to a trunk link must be VLAN-aware. All frames on this should have a special header attached to it called tagged frames.\n2. **Access link \u2013**\n\nIt connects VLAN-unaware devices to a VLAN-aware bridge. All frames on the access link must be untagged.\n3. **Hybrid link \u2013**\n\nIt is a combination of the Trunk link and Access link. Here both VLAN-unaware and VLAN-aware devices are attached and it can have both tagged and untagged frames.\n\n**Advantages \u2013**\n\n- **Performance \u2013**\n\nThe network traffic is full of broadcast and multicast. VLAN reduces the need to send such traffic to unnecessary destinations. e.g.-If the traffic is intended for 2 users but as 10 devices are present in the same broadcast domain, therefore, all will receive the traffic i.e. wastage of bandwidth but if we make VLANs, then the broadcast or multicast packet will go to the intended users only.\n- **Formation of virtual groups \u2013**\n\nAs there are different departments in every organization namely sales, finance etc., VLANs can be very useful in order to group the devices logically according to their departments.\n- **Security \u2013**\n\nIn the same network, sensitive data can be broadcast which can be accessed by the outsider but by creating VLAN, we can control broadcast domains, set up firewalls, restrict access. Also, VLANs can be used to inform the network manager of an intrusion. Hence, VLANs greatly enhance network security.\n- **Flexibility \u2013**\n\nVLAN provide flexibility to add, remove the number of host we want.\n- **Cost reduction \u2013**\n\nVLANs can be used to create broadcast domains which eliminate the need for expensive routers.\n\nBy using Vlan, the number of small size broadcast domain can be increased which are easy to handle as compared to a bigger broadcast domain.\n\n**Disadvantages of VLAN**\n\n1. **Complexity:** VLANs can be complex to configure and manage, particularly in large or dynamic cloud computing environments.\n2. **Limited scalability:** VLANs are limited by the number of available VLAN IDs, which can be a constraint in larger cloud computing environments.\n3. **Limited security**: VLANs do not provide complete security and can be compromised by malicious actors who are able to gain access to the network.\n4. **Limited interoperability**: VLANs may not be fully compatible with all types of network devices and protocols, which can limit their usefulness in cloud computing environments.\n5. **Limited mobility**: VLANs may not support the movement of devices or users between different network segments, which can limit their usefulness in mobile or remote cloud computing environments.\n6. **Cost:** Implementing and maintaining VLANs can be costly, especially if specialized hardware or software is required.\n7. **Limited visibility:** VLANs can make it more difficult to monitor and troubleshoot network issues, as traffic is isolated in different segments.\n\n**Real-Time Applications of VLAN**\n\nVirtual LANs (VLANs) are widely used in cloud computing environments to improve network performance and security. Here are a few examples of real-time applications of VLANs:\n\n1. **Voice over IP (VoIP)** : VLANs can be used to isolate voice traffic from data traffic, which improves the quality of VoIP calls and reduces the risk of network congestion.\n2. **Video Conferencing** : VLANs can be used to prioritize video traffic and ensure that it receives the bandwidth and resources it needs for high-quality video conferencing.\n3. **Remote Access** : VLANs can be used to provide secure remote access to cloud-based applications and resources, by isolating remote users from the rest of the network.\n4. **Cloud Backup and Recovery** : VLANs can be used to isolate backup and recovery traffic, which reduces the risk of network congestion and improves the performance of backup and recovery operations.\n5. **Gaming** : VLANs can be used to prioritize gaming traffic, which ensures that gamers receive the bandwidth and resources they need for a smooth gaming experience.\n6. **IoT** : VLANs can be used to isolate Internet of Things (IoT) devices from the rest of the network, which improves security and reduces the risk of network congestion.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configuring-and-verifying-vlans-in-cisco/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Configuring and Verifying VLANs in Cisco](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configuring-and-verifying-vlans-in-cisco/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n34\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

However, wired methods are proven more effective than wireless. But while networking, it\u2019s troublesome to manage many wires at once. To solve this problem, link aggregation plays a vital role. since it\u2019s known to carry multiple ports collectively as a single channel. In other words, link aggregation combines multiple physical ports as one port, which makes it easy to carry out the task by the user. Also, it makes the process cost-effective.\n\nThe link aggregation control protocol provides an effective method for bundling several physical links in a single logical link, which enables a network device to create an automatic aggregation of links, and also includes the transmission of LACP packets to the different network devices and implementation it through direct connect device.\n\nMainly, it improves the bandwidth and resilience of Ethernet networks. With the use of link aggregation, the idea of integrating several physical connections into one logical connection can help in developing more durable communications.\n\nThis article will focus on the LACP or link aggregation control protocol. We will go through its architecture, its working procedure, and its use in computer networking, as well as how to configure the LACP. and its advantages.\n\n### Link Aggregation Control Protocol:\n\nLACP is an IEEE standard, which is a part of the [IEEE 802.3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ieee-802-3-802-4-and-802-5/) ad specification. It allows the user to combine numerous physical Ethernet links into one logical link, which helps create load balancing in the interfaces. LACP Ether Channel can be configured with a maximum of 16 Ethernet ports of the same kind. In that case, only up to eight links in the Link Aggregation Group will be activated, while the remaining eight links will be on standby mode.\n\nIn the process, link aggregation takes place through two different modes, Active or Passive. Both are briefly explained below:\n\n- **Active:** To form an LACP connection, this interface keeps sending packets actively.\n- **Passive:** On the other hand, in the passive mode, the interface can give a response to LACP, but cannot initiate itself.\n\n### Structure of LACP:\n\nLink aggregation applies to any three bottom layers of the OSI model. Here, power lines and wireless network devices, which combine multiple frequency bands, can be a good example of link aggregation at layer1 or the [Physical layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/).\n\nIn [layer2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/), it usually happens between the switch ports, for instance, Ethernet frame in LAN or multi-link PPP in WAN, data link layer, or Ethernet MAC address, which can be either virtual or physical ports.\n\nIn the network layer or layer3, it can use the Round-robin scheduling. For aggregation at layer 3 of the OSI model, hash code computed from fields in the packet header, or combining both methods, can be used.\n\nIt can maintain the balance in network load across all links, regardless of the aggregation layer. However, it may not be used in some cases to avoid out-of-order delivery. In most cases, the failover is also included in this kind of method.\n\nIn the process, combining is possible only if either, the majority of interfaces are sharing the same IP address or the other way is when each interface has its address. Here, the first one may need both ends of a link to share the same aggregating procedure, but it is considerably better in terms of performance.\n\nOn the other hand, Load balancing divides the traffic across the interfaces based on the network socket or layer 4, besides, the channel bonding indicates a lower-level division of traffic between physical interfaces, either based on the per-packet or the data link.\n\n### Features of LACP:\n\n1. The maximum range of a valid number of ports is 1 to 8, which are used in the channel.\n2. To send LACP packets with multiple grouping, the MAC address 01:80:C2:00:00:02 is used.\n3. During the process of LACP detection, the LACP packets are sent every second, and also the keep-alive mechanism for link members can work faster by the 1sec. and slower by the 30sec. (which is set by default)\n4. The option of load-balancing mode is also available, which can be selected in some cases. But not necessarily at all.\n5. The LACP mode contains two main modes, active and passive. Active mode helps the LACP to run indefinitely. On the other hand, the passive mode can activate LACP only, once the LACP device is found. Which is also a default setting.\n\n### Standardization of the Link Aggregation:\n\nThe standardization of the link aggregation includes the two main standards of link aggregation control protocol.\n\n**1\\. The 802.3ad IEEE Link Aggregation:**\n\nThe IEEE 802.3ad of Link aggregation makes it easy for the users to group Ethernet interfaces at the physical layer to create a single link-layer interface, often known as a LAG or bundle.\n\nSometimes the user needs more bandwidth in the network, which is not possible with a single Ethernet link. However, a high-speed Gigabit Ethernet link can be very expensive. On the other hand, using IEEE 802.3ad link aggregation can be a good solution. It can increase port density and bandwidth at a very less cost. Take an example, suppose there is a need for 450 Mbps of bandwidth for data transmission, but there is only a 100 Mbps Ethernet link available. In this kind of situation, it is more convenient to create a LAG bundle of Five 100 Mbps fast Ethernet links than to buy a single Ethernet link.\n\nAs for functionalities, the link aggregation provides protocols, and procedures, and manages the objects to allow one or more parallel instances of full-duplex links to be aggregated together, to form a Link Aggregation Group or LAG.\n\n**2\\. The 802.1AX:**\n\nThe IEEE 802.1AX-2008 is an upgraded version of 802.3ad IEEE standard, which is usually used to bundle up the multiple network connections into the parallel full-duplex point-to-point link, which can be used as a single point link. this kind of link aggregation provides a higher availability and transmission speed than the conventional connection.\n\n### How to Configure LACP?\n\n1. First of all, enable the LACP, and then, configure the per-port specific LACP, either in Active mode or Passive mode. Usually, the range of group numbers goes from 0 to 7.\n2. In the second step, the user needs to set a timeout for the LACP session, which defines the amount of time that a port channel will wait for a LACPDU before terminating the LACP session. It can go 3sec shorter to 90sec longer.\n3. The third step is to set a priority value. It can be high or low accordingly. By default, it is 255, but the range can go higher to 1-65535.\n4. View the LACP configuration.\n\nHere are screenshots for a better understanding of the process:\n\n![LACP Port Selection](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220501192652/LACPTopport1-660x312.png)\n\nLACP Port Selection\n\n![LACP Commands](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220501192726/LACPBotport2-660x193.png)\n\nLACP Commands\n\n### Benefits **:**\n\n1. **Increased bandwidth:** The main advantage of the link aggregation control protocol is that it is capable of combining multiple links into one logical link. which helps increase the bandwidth of the network.\n2. **Automatic occurrence of failover and failback:** once the link failure occurs, the traffic under the failed link then automatically turned onto the other available links. Which makes it a reliable method for data transmission.\n3. **Cost-effective method:** link aggregation is a cost-effective method. It combines multiple links into one, which makes it less costly and reliable at the same time.\n4. **Less drain on the network address pool:** The whole aggregation process can be assigned one IP address. which makes it a less confusing and time-saving method.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-snooping/?ref=next_article)\n\n[DHCP Snooping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-snooping/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/prinkalkashyap711/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[prinkalkashyap711](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/prinkalkashyap711/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

Frames are comparable to the packets of energy called photons in the case of light energy. Frame is continuously used in Time Division Multiplexing process.\n\nFraming is a point-to-point connection between two computers or devices consisting of a wire in which data is transmitted as a stream of bits. However, these bits must be framed into discernible blocks of information. Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, and other data link layer technologies have their own frame structures. Frames have headers that contain information such as error-checking codes.\n\n![1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/1-30.png)\n\nAt the data link layer, it extracts the message from the sender and provides it to the receiver by providing the sender\u2019s and receiver\u2019s addresses. The advantage of using frames is that data is broken up into recoverable chunks that can easily be checked for corruption.\n\nThe process of dividing the data into frames and reassembling it is transparent to the user and is handled by the data link layer.\n\nFraming is an important aspect of data link layer protocol design because it allows the transmission of data to be organized and controlled, ensuring that the data is delivered accurately and efficiently.\n\n**Problems in Framing**\n\n- **Detecting start of the frame:** When a frame is transmitted, every station must be able to detect it. Station detects frames by looking out for a special sequence of bits that marks the beginning of the frame i.e. SFD (Starting Frame Delimiter).\n- **How does the** **station detect a frame:** Every station listens to link for SFD pattern through a sequential circuit. If SFD is detected, sequential circuit alerts station. Station checks destination address to accept or reject frame.\n- **Detecting end of frame:** When to stop reading the frame.\n- **Handling errors:** Framing errors may occur due to noise or other transmission errors, which can cause a station to misinterpret the frame. Therefore, error detection and correction mechanisms, such as cyclic redundancy check (CRC), are used to ensure the integrity of the frame.\n- **Framing overhead:** Every frame has a header and a trailer that contains control information such as source and destination address, error detection code, and other protocol-related information. This overhead reduces the available bandwidth for data transmission, especially for small-sized frames.\n- **Framing incompatibility:** Different networking devices and protocols may use different framing methods, which can lead to framing incompatibility issues. For example, if a device using one framing method sends data to a device using a different framing method, the receiving device may not be able to correctly interpret the frame.\n- **Framing synchronization:** Stations must be synchronized with each other to avoid collisions and ensure reliable communication. Synchronization requires that all stations agree on the frame boundaries and timing, which can be challenging in complex networks with many devices and varying traffic loads.\n- **Framing efficiency:** Framing should be designed to minimize the amount of data overhead while maximizing the available bandwidth for data transmission. Inefficient framing methods can lead to lower network performance and higher latency.\n\n### **Types of framing**\n\nThere are two types of framing:\n\n**1\\. Fixed-size:** The frame is of fixed size and there is no need to provide boundaries to the frame, the length of the frame itself acts as a delimiter.\n\n- **Drawback:** It suffers from internal fragmentation if the data size is less than the frame size\n- **Solution:** Padding\n\n**2\\. Variable size:** In this, there is a need to define the end of the frame as well as the beginning of the next frame to distinguish. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. **Length field \u2013** We can introduce a length field in the frame to indicate the length of the frame. Used in **Ethernet(802.3)**. The problem with this is that sometimes the length field might get corrupted.\n2. **End Delimiter (ED) \u2013** We can introduce an ED(pattern) to indicate the end of the frame. Used in **Token Ring**. The problem with this is that ED can occur in the data. This can be solved by:\n\n**1\\. Character/Byte Stuffing:** Used when frames consist of characters. If data contains ED then, a byte is stuffed into data to differentiate it from ED.\n\nLet ED = \u201c$\u201d \u2013> if data contains \u2018$\u2019 anywhere, it can be escaped using \u2018\\\\O\u2019 character.\n\n\u2013\\> if data contains \u2018\\\\O$\u2019 then, use \u2018\\\\O\\\\O\\\\O$'($ is escaped using \\\\O and \\\\O is escaped using \\\\O).\n\n\n![2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/2-14.png)\n\n**Disadvantage \u2013** It is very costly and obsolete method.\n\n**2\\. Bit Stuffing:** Let ED = 01111 and if data = 01111\n\n**\u2013>** Sender stuffs a bit to break the pattern i.e. here appends a 0 in data = 0111 **0** 1.\n\n**\u2013>** Receiver receives the frame.\n\n**\u2013>** If data contains 011101, receiver removes the 0 and reads the data.\n\n![3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/3-12.png)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- If Data \u2013> 011100011110 and ED \u2013> 0111 then, find data after bit stuffing.\n\n```\n--> 011010001101100\n```\n\n- If Data \u2013> 110001001 and ED \u2013> 1000 then, find data after bit stuffing?\n\n```\n--> 11001010011\n```\n\n#### framing in the Data Link Layer also presents some challenges, which include:\n\n**Variable frame length:** The length of frames can vary depending on the data being transmitted, which can lead to inefficiencies in transmission. To address this issue, protocols such as HDLC and PPP use a flag sequence to mark the start and end of each frame.\n\n**Bit stuffing:** Bit stuffing is a technique used to prevent data from being interpreted as control characters by inserting extra bits into the data stream. However, bit stuffing can lead to issues with synchronization and increase the overhead of the transmission.\n\n**Synchronization:** Synchronization is critical for ensuring that data frames are transmitted and received correctly. However, synchronization can be challenging, particularly in high-speed networks where frames are transmitted rapidly.\n\n**Error detection:** Data Link Layer protocols use various techniques to detect errors in the transmitted data, such as checksums and CRCs. However, these techniques are not foolproof and can miss some types of errors.\n\n**Efficiency:** Efficient use of available bandwidth is critical for ensuring that data is transmitted quickly and reliably. However, the overhead associated with framing and error detection can reduce the overall efficiency of the transmission.\n\n- [Gate CS 2014](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2014-set-3-question-34/)\n- [Gate IT 2004](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-it-2004-question-80/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-control-in-data-link-layer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Error Control in Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-control-in-data-link-layer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit87/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Ankit87](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit87/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

Digital signals suffer from noise during transmission that can introduce errors in the binary bits traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0.\n\nData (Implemented either at the Data link layer or Transport Layer of the OSI Model) may get scrambled by noise or get corrupted whenever a message is transmitted. To prevent such errors, error-detection codes are added as extra data to digital messages. This helps in detecting any errors that may have occurred during message transmission.\n\n## Types of Errors\n\n### Single-Bit Error\n\nA single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting in an incorrect or corrupted data unit.\n\n![single bit error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425112041/single-bit-error.png)\n\nSingle-Bit Error\n\n### Multiple-Bit Error\n\nA multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors, they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or high-interference digital environments.\n\n![Multiple bit error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425112939/multiple-bit-error.png)\n\nMultiple-Bit Error\n\n### Burst Error\n\nWhen several consecutive bits are flipped mistakenly in digital transmission, it creates a burst error. This error causes a sequence of consecutive incorrect values.\n\n![Burst error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425113404/burst-error.png)\n\nBurst Error\n\n## Error Detection Methods\n\nTo detect errors, a common technique is to introduce redundancy bits that provide additional information. Various techniques for error detection include:\n\n- Simple Parity Check\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check\n- Checksum\n- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\n## Simple Parity Check\n\nSimple-bit parity is a simple error detection method that involves adding an extra bit to a data transmission. It works as:\n\n- 1 is added to the block if it contains an odd number of 1\u2019s, and\n- 0 is added if it contains an even number of 1\u2019s\n\nThis scheme makes the total number of 1\u2019s even, that is why it is called [even parity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-even-parity-is-different-from-odd-parity/) checking.\n\n![Even parity check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect12.jpg)\n\n### **Advantages of Simple Parity Check**\n\n- Simple parity check can detect all single bit error.\n- Simple parity check can detect an odd number of errors.\n- **Implementation**: Simple Parity Check is easy to implement in both hardware and software.\n- **Minimal Extra Data**: Only one additional bit (the parity bit) is added per data unit (e.g., per byte).\n- **Fast Error Detection**: The process of calculating and checking the parity bit is quick, which allows for rapid error detection without significant delay in data processing or communication.\n- **Single-Bit Error Detection**: It can effectively detect single-bit errors within a data unit, providing a basic level of error detection for relatively low-error environments.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Simple Parity Check**\n\n- Single Parity check is not able to detect even no. of bit error.\n- **For example,** the Data to be transmitted is **101010**. Codeword transmitted to the receiver is 1010101 (we have used even parity).\n\nLet\u2019s assume that during transmission, two of the bits of code word flipped to 1111101.\n\nOn receiving the code word, the receiver finds the no. of ones to be even and hence **no error,** which is a wrong assumption _._\n\n## Two-Dimensional Parity Check\n\n**Two-dimensional Parity check** bits are calculated for each row, which is equivalent to a simple parity check bit. Parity check bits are also calculated for all columns, then both are sent along with the data. At the receiving end, these are compared with the parity bits calculated on the received data.\n\n## ![2-D parity check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect11.jpg)\n\n### **Advantages of Two-Dimensional Parity Check**\n\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can detect and correct all single bit error.\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can detect two or three bit error that occur any where in the matrix.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Two-Dimensional Parity Check**\n\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can not correct two or three bit error. It can only detect two or three bit error.\n- If we have a error in the parity bit then this scheme will not work.\n\n## Checksum\n\nChecksum error detection is a method used to identify errors in transmitted data. The process involves dividing the data into equally sized segments and using a [1\u2019s complement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ones-complement/) to calculate the sum of these segments. The calculated sum is then sent along with the data to the receiver. At the receiver\u2019s end, the same process is repeated and if all zeroes are obtained in the sum, it means that the data is correct.\n\n### **Checksum \u2013 Operation at Sender\u2019s Side**\n\n- Firstly, the data is divided into k segments each of m bits.\n- On the sender\u2019s end, the segments are added using 1\u2019s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented to get the checksum.\n- The checksum segment is sent along with the data segments.\n\n### **Checksum \u2013 Operation at Receiver\u2019s Side**\n\n- At the receiver\u2019s end, all received segments are added using 1\u2019s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented.\n- If the result is zero, the received data is accepted; otherwise discarded.\n\n### ![Checksum](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect13.jpg)\n\nRead more about [Checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/)\n\n## Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\n- Unlike the checksum scheme, which is based on addition, CRC is based on [binary division](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-division/).\n- In CRC, a sequence of redundant bits, called cyclic redundancy check bits, are appended to the end of the data unit so that the resulting data unit becomes exactly divisible by a second, predetermined binary number.\n- At the destination, the incoming data unit is divided by the same number. If at this step there is no remainder, the data unit is assumed to be correct and is therefore accepted.\n- A remainder indicates that the data unit has been damaged in transit and therefore must be rejected.\n\n### ![CRC](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect14.jpg)**CRC Working**\n\nWe have given dataword of length n and divisor of length k.\n\n**Step 1:** Append (k-1) zero\u2019s to the original message\n\n**Step 2:** Perform modulo 2 division\n\n**Step 3:** Remainder of division = CRC\n\n**Step 4:** Code word = Data with append k-1 zero\u2019s + CRC\n\nNote:\n\n- CRC must be k-1 bits\n- Length of Code word = n+k-1 bits\n\nExample: Let\u2019s data to be send is 1010000 and divisor in the form of polynomial is x3+1\\. CRC method discussed below.\n\n### ![CRC-Example](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect15.jpg)\n\nRead in detail about [Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/videos/cyclic-redundancy-checkcrc/)\n\nPrevious year GATE questions based on error detection: [GATE CS 2009 Question 48](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2009-question-48/) [GATE CS 2007 Question 68](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2007-question-68/).\n\n## Advantages of Error Detection\n\n- **Increased Data Reliability:** Error detection ensures that the data transmitted over the network is reliable, accurate, and free from errors. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender.\n- **Improved Network Performance:** Error detection mechanisms can help to identify and isolate network issues that are causing errors. This can help to improve the overall performance of the network and reduce downtime.\n- **Enhanced Data Security:** Error detection can also help to ensure that the data transmitted over the network is secure and has not been tampered with.\n\n## Disadvantages of Error Detection\n\n- **Overhead**:Error detection requires additional resources and processing power, which can lead to increased overhead on the network. This can result in slower network performance and increased latency.\n- **False Positives:** Error detection mechanisms can sometimes generate false positives, which can result in unnecessary retransmission of data. This can further increase the overhead on the network.\n- **Limited Error Correction:** Error detection can only identify errors but cannot correct them. This means that the recipient must rely on the sender to retransmit the data, which can lead to further delays and increased network overhead.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Error Detection \u2013 FAQs\n\n### How many types of error detection are there?\n\n> There are several types of error detection methods commonly used in computer networks.

Digital signals suffer from noise during transmission that can introduce errors in the binary bits traveling from sender to receiver. That means a 0 bit may change to 1 or a 1 bit may change to 0.\n\nData (Implemented either at the Data link layer or Transport Layer of the OSI Model) may get scrambled by noise or get corrupted whenever a message is transmitted. To prevent such errors, error-detection codes are added as extra data to digital messages. This helps in detecting any errors that may have occurred during message transmission.\n\n## Types of Errors\n\n### Single-Bit Error\n\nA single-bit error refers to a type of data transmission error that occurs when one bit (i.e., a single binary digit) of a transmitted data unit is altered during transmission, resulting in an incorrect or corrupted data unit.\n\n![single bit error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425112041/single-bit-error.png)\n\nSingle-Bit Error\n\n### Multiple-Bit Error\n\nA multiple-bit error is an error type that arises when more than one bit in a data transmission is affected. Although multiple-bit errors are relatively rare when compared to single-bit errors, they can still occur, particularly in high-noise or high-interference digital environments.\n\n![Multiple bit error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230425112939/multiple-bit-error.png)\n\nMultiple-Bit Error\n\n### Burst Error\n\nWhen several consecutive bits are flipped mistakenly in digital transmission, it creates a burst error.

Various techniques for error detection include:\n\n- Simple Parity Check\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check\n- Checksum\n- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\n## Simple Parity Check\n\nSimple-bit parity is a simple error detection method that involves adding an extra bit to a data transmission. It works as:\n\n- 1 is added to the block if it contains an odd number of 1\u2019s, and\n- 0 is added if it contains an even number of 1\u2019s\n\nThis scheme makes the total number of 1\u2019s even, that is why it is called [even parity](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-even-parity-is-different-from-odd-parity/) checking.\n\n![Even parity check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect12.jpg)\n\n### **Advantages of Simple Parity Check**\n\n- Simple parity check can detect all single bit error.\n- Simple parity check can detect an odd number of errors.\n- **Implementation**: Simple Parity Check is easy to implement in both hardware and software.\n- **Minimal Extra Data**: Only one additional bit (the parity bit) is added per data unit (e.g., per byte).\n- **Fast Error Detection**: The process of calculating and checking the parity bit is quick, which allows for rapid error detection without significant delay in data processing or communication.\n- **Single-Bit Error Detection**: It can effectively detect single-bit errors within a data unit, providing a basic level of error detection for relatively low-error environments.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Simple Parity Check**\n\n- Single Parity check is not able to detect even no. of bit error.\n- **For example,** the Data to be transmitted is **101010**. Codeword transmitted to the receiver is 1010101 (we have used even parity).\n\nLet\u2019s assume that during transmission, two of the bits of code word flipped to 1111101.\n\nOn receiving the code word, the receiver finds the no. of ones to be even and hence **no error,** which is a wrong assumption _._\n\n## Two-Dimensional Parity Check\n\n**Two-dimensional Parity check** bits are calculated for each row, which is equivalent to a simple parity check bit. Parity check bits are also calculated for all columns, then both are sent along with the data. At the receiving end, these are compared with the parity bits calculated on the received data.\n\n## ![2-D parity check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect11.jpg)\n\n### **Advantages of Two-Dimensional Parity Check**\n\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can detect and correct all single bit error.\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can detect two or three bit error that occur any where in the matrix.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Two-Dimensional Parity Check**\n\n- Two-Dimensional Parity Check can not correct two or three bit error. It can only detect two or three bit error.\n- If we have a error in the parity bit then this scheme will not work.\n\n## Checksum\n\nChecksum error detection is a method used to identify errors in transmitted data. The process involves dividing the data into equally sized segments and using a [1\u2019s complement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ones-complement/) to calculate the sum of these segments. The calculated sum is then sent along with the data to the receiver. At the receiver\u2019s end, the same process is repeated and if all zeroes are obtained in the sum, it means that the data is correct.\n\n### **Checksum \u2013 Operation at Sender\u2019s Side**\n\n- Firstly, the data is divided into k segments each of m bits.\n- On the sender\u2019s end, the segments are added using 1\u2019s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented to get the checksum.\n- The checksum segment is sent along with the data segments.\n\n### **Checksum \u2013 Operation at Receiver\u2019s Side**\n\n- At the receiver\u2019s end, all received segments are added using 1\u2019s complement arithmetic to get the sum. The sum is complemented.\n- If the result is zero, the received data is accepted; otherwise discarded.\n\n### ![Checksum](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect13.jpg)\n\nRead more about [Checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/)\n\n## Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\n- Unlike the checksum scheme, which is based on addition, CRC is based on [binary division](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-division/).\n- In CRC, a sequence of redundant bits, called cyclic redundancy check bits, are appended to the end of the data unit so that the resulting data unit becomes exactly divisible by a second, predetermined binary number.\n- At the destination, the incoming data unit is divided by the same number. If at this step there is no remainder, the data unit is assumed to be correct and is therefore accepted.\n- A remainder indicates that the data unit has been damaged in transit and therefore must be rejected.\n\n### ![CRC](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect14.jpg)**CRC Working**\n\nWe have given dataword of length n and divisor of length k.\n\n**Step 1:** Append (k-1) zero\u2019s to the original message\n\n**Step 2:** Perform modulo 2 division\n\n**Step 3:** Remainder of division = CRC\n\n**Step 4:** Code word = Data with append k-1 zero\u2019s + CRC\n\nNote:\n\n- CRC must be k-1 bits\n- Length of Code word = n+k-1 bits\n\nExample: Let\u2019s data to be send is 1010000 and divisor in the form of polynomial is x3+1\\. CRC method discussed below.\n\n### ![CRC-Example](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/detect15.jpg)\n\nRead in detail about [Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/videos/cyclic-redundancy-checkcrc/)\n\nPrevious year GATE questions based on error detection: [GATE CS 2009 Question 48](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2009-question-48/) [GATE CS 2007 Question 68](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2007-question-68/).\n\n## Advantages of Error Detection\n\n- **Increased Data Reliability:** Error detection ensures that the data transmitted over the network is reliable, accurate, and free from errors. This ensures that the recipient receives the same data that was transmitted by the sender.\n- **Improved Network Performance:** Error detection mechanisms can help to identify and isolate network issues that are causing errors. This can help to improve the overall performance of the network and reduce downtime.\n- **Enhanced Data Security:** Error detection can also help to ensure that the data transmitted over the network is secure and has not been tampered with.\n\n## Disadvantages of Error Detection\n\n- **Overhead**:Error detection requires additional resources and processing power, which can lead to increased overhead on the network. This can result in slower network performance and increased latency.\n- **False Positives:** Error detection mechanisms can sometimes generate false positives, which can result in unnecessary retransmission of data. This can further increase the overhead on the network.\n- **Limited Error Correction:** Error detection can only identify errors but cannot correct them. This means that the recipient must rely on the sender to retransmit the data, which can lead to further delays and increased network overhead.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Error Detection \u2013 FAQs\n\n### How many types of error detection are there?\n\n> There are several types of error detection methods commonly used in computer networks.

However, the data transfer over a network includes many complex processes that cause some flaws in the data transmission. These flaws are called Errors which can be of different types. Therefore, it is important to correct them for efficient data transmission.\n\nIn this article, we will learn about the different methods of Error Correction in Computer Networks. We will also see the types of errors and methods to identify them. This will resolve all your doubts about the Error Correction and its methods.\n\n## What are Errors in Networking?\n\nThe error simply means any flaw or deviation that occurs while the information is transmitted from the source to the destination in a computer network. In other words, if the message or data transmitted by the source is not identical to the one received at the destination, we can say there is some [Error in the Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-errors-in-computer-network/).\n\nIn a Network, the data or message is transferred in the form of bits that follow a specific sequence. If there is any deviation in the bit sequence, it is called an Error. Now, let us understand the types of Errors that occur in the Compute Network.\n\n## Types of Network Errors\n\n### 1\\. Single-Bit Error\n\nThis error occurs when the single bit (single binary digit) in the message is flipped during the transmission and the received message at the destination side differs from the original message by a single bit. For example, if a single 1(set bit) in the source message is flipped to 0 or a 0 is flipped to 1, we can say that there is a Single-Bit Error in Transmission which is shown below:\n\n![Single Bit Error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232604/1.jpg)\n\n### 2\\. Multiple-Bit Error\n\nThis occurs when there is a deviation in multiple bits of the message during its transfer from source to destination. The bits that are flipped need not be a continuous sequence of bits. Thus, a Multiple-Bit Error is found when any non-continuous sequence of bits is flipped in the transmitted message. The example of this error is illustrated below:\n\n![Multiple Bit Error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232605/2.jpg)\n\n### 3\\. Burst Error\n\nThis is similar to the Multiple-Bits Error with just one difference the bits that are flipped follow a continuous sequence in their bit representation. This error can occur due a physical damage to the disk which causes a change in the consecutive bit sequence of the source message. An example of a Burst Error is demonstrated below:\n\n![Burst Error](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232605/3.jpg)\n\nAfter we have learned about the different types of errors, let us see how to identify them so that we can select the appropriate method to correct the Network errors.\n\n## Error Identification in Computer Network\n\n### Parity Check\n\nIn this technique, the sender appends an extra parity bit to the message. If the total number of ones in the bit sequence is odd, 1 is added as a parity bit. And, if it is even, 0 acts as a parity bit. During transmission or storage, if an error alters the number of bits, the parity bit will be used to identify whether there is an error or not. This is illustrated as shown below:\n\n![Parity Check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232606/4.jpg)\n\n### Two-Dimensional Parity Check\n\nThis is just a variation of the Single-Bit Parity Check in which the original method is transformed into a matrix in which each column is associated with a parity bit based on the number of occurrences of 1s. At the receiving end, if the message has been corrupted in some way, the parity bit can identify that the message is corrupted due to some error. This is illustrated in the below example.\n\n![Two DImensional Parity Check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232607/5.jpg)\n\n### Checksum\n\nThis method adds up all the bits and adds the sum to the message while transmitting. This sum is called the checksum. The sender calculates the checksum before transmitting the data, and the recipient recalculates it upon receiving the data. If the two checksum values do not match with each other, there is some error in the network. However if they match, there is no error. An example of checksum is shown below:\n\n![Check Sum](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232607/6.jpg)\n\n### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\nThe [CRC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-2-binary-division/) method is similar to the Checksum method with the difference that this method deals with binary division instead of binary addition. In this method, the repeated or redundant sequence of bits in the source message is identified. Then, it is added to the source message. Now, the source message will be easily divisible by the binary number formed from redundant bits which is called CRC Value.\n\nThus, the source message is divided by the CRC value which gives the divisor. Before the message is accepted, the receiver divides the bit sequence by the CRC value. If the remainder is zero, there is no error. But, if the remainder after dividing by the CRC value is not zero, it means that there is an error that needs to be corrected. The CRC method is outlined below:\n\n![Cycle Redundancy Check](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232608/7.jpg)\n\nAfter we have learned to identify the Errors in Computer Networks, it is now time to correct them.\n\n## Error Correction in Computer Networks\n\nOnce the errors are detected in the network, the deviated bits sequence needs to be replaced with the right bit sequence so that the receiver can accept the data and process it. This method is called Error Correction. We can correct the errors in the Network in two different ways which are listed below:\n\n- **Forward Error Correction:** In this Error Correction Scenario, the receiving end is responsible for correcting the network error. There is no need for retransmission of the data from the sender\u2019s side.\n\n- **Backward Error Correction:** the sender is responsible for retransmitting the data if errors are detected by the receiver. The receiver signals the sender to resend the corrupted data or the entire message to ensure accurate delivery.\n\nHowever, there is one of the most widely used Error Correction methods which is called \u2018 [Hamming Code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hamming-code-in-computer-network/)\u2019 which was designed by R.W. Hamming. Let us have a quick look at it.\n\n### Hamming Code Error Correction\n\nIn this method extra parity bits are appended to the message which are used by the receiver to correct the single bit error and multiple bit error. Consider the below example to understand this method in a better way.\n\nSuppose the sender wants to transmit the message whose bit representation is \u20181011001.\u2019 In this message:\n\n- Total number of bits (d) = 7\n\n- Total of redundant bits (r) = 4 (This is because the message has four 1\u2019s in it)\n\n- Thus, total bits (d+r) = 7 + 4 = 11\n\nAlso by convention the redundant bits are always placed in the places which are powers of 2. Now this message will take the format as shown below:\n\n![Redundant Bits](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232609/8.jpg)\n\nTherefore we have R1, R2, R3, and R4 as redundant bits which will be calculated according to the following rules:\n\n- R1 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in their least significant bit. Thus, R1 covers positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\n- R2 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in the second position from the least significant bit. Thus, R2 covers positions 2,3,6,7,10,11.\n\n- R3 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in the third position from the least significant bit. Hence, R3 covers positions 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n- R4 includes all the positions whose binary representation has 1 in the fourth position from the least significant bit due to which R4 covers positions 8,9,10,11.\n\n**These rules are illustrated below:**\n\n![Rukes of Redundant Bits](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232609/9.jpg)\n\nNow, we calculate the value of R1, R2, R3 and R4 as follows:\n\n- Since the total number of 1s in all the bit positions corresponding to R1 is an even number. R1 = 0.\n\n- Since the total number of 1s in all the bit positions corresponding to R2 is an odd number, R2= 1.\n\n- Since the total number of 1s in all the bit positions corresponding to R3 is an odd number, R3= 1.\n\n- Since the total number of 1s in all the bit positions corresponding to R4 is even, R4 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the message to be transmitted becomes:\n\n![Redundant Bits](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231121232610/10.jpg)\n\nThis message is transmitted at the receiver\u2019s end. Suppose, bit 6 becomes corrupted and changes to 1. Then the message becomes \u201810101101110.\u2019 So at the receiver\u2019s end the number of 1\u2019s in the respective bit positions of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is rechecked to correct the corrupted bit. This is done in the following steps: For all the parity bits we will check the\n\n- For R1: bits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 are checked. We can see that the number of 1\u2019s in these bit positions is 4(even) so R1 = 0.\n\n- For R2: bits 2,3,6,7,10,11 are checked. You can observe that the number of 1\u2019s in these bit positions is 5(odd) so we get a R2 = 1.\n\n- For R3: bits 4, 5, 6, and 7 are checked. We see that the number of 1\u2019s in these bit positions is 3(odd). Hence, R3 = 1.\n\n- For R8: bits 8,9,10,11 are observed. Here, the number of 1\u2019s in these bit positions is 2 and that\u2019s even so we get R4 = 0.\n\nIf we observe the Redundant bits, they give the binary number 0110 whose decimal representation is 6. The **error in bit 6** has been successfully identified and corrected. By rechecking the parity bits, we could detect that **R4** was not matching its expected value, pointing us to the corrupted bit. The bit 6 should have been **1**, and after correcting it, the message is now error-free.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nErrors are encountered where there is a difference between the sequence of bits of the source message and the received message while data is transferred over the Network. The Errors create a lot of problems in the information transfer by corrupting the data. Thus, the receiver becomes unable to further process the data, due to which the request-response cycle slows down over the network.\n\nAfter learning about the different methods to correct these errors, we can easily make sure the data transfer doesn\u2019t face any discrepancy or inconsistency. You have received enough information about the Error Correction methods in networking.\n\n## Error Correction in Computer Networks - FAQ's\n\n### **Does Error Correction use additional network bandwidth?**\n\n> Yes, if the method of Error Correction deals with the retransmission of the packets from the sender\u2019s side, there might be additional usage of network bandwidth that causes an increase in network cost.\n\n### **What is the Redundancy Check method in Error Correction?**\n\n> A redundancy check simply means adding a certain bit sequence at the end of the message. This added sequence acts as redundant bits and at the receiver\u2019s side, these redundant bits can be checked to verify whether the message transmission is error-free or not.\n\n### **What is Jitter in Networking?**\n\n> A jitter is another type of network error that is caused by to inconsistent arrival of the data packets at the receiver\u2019s end. Due to this, there is a variation in the arrival time of the message. This error can be observed in voice or audio communication in which the voice or audio is not delivered properly.\n\n### **Does low latency signify a network error?**\n\n> Low latency means delayed delivery of the data packets. If there is an issue in the network speed for bandwidth, it can be easily rectified. But, if it occurs due to corrupted data or loss of data packets, it can termed as a Network Error.\n\n### **What is the ARQ method?**\n\n> ARQ is a protocol for backward error correction that automatically detects and requests the retransmission of erroneous packets from the sender\u2019s side. This method asks the sender to resend packets that are corrupted or lost.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Error Detection in Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/y5cvaatm7dqbfl6u0fxn)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tarakki100/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[tarakki100](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tarakki100/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2023/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Error Correction in Computer Networks\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nComputer Networks play a crucial role in the secured and encrypted transmission of data over the internet.

Using or providing error control at this data link layer is an optimization, it was never a requirement. Error control is basically process in data link layer of detecting or identifying and re-transmitting data frames that might be lost or corrupted during transmission. In both of these cases, receiver or destination does not receive correct data frame and sender or source does not even know anything about any such loss regarding data frames. Therefore, in such type of cases, both sender and receiver are provided with some essential protocols that are required to detect or identify such types of errors as loss of data frames. The Data-link layer follows a technique known as re-transmission of frames to detect or identify transit errors and also to take necessary actions that are required to reduce or remove such errors. Each and every time an error is detected during transmission, particular data frames are retransmitted and this process is known as ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request).\n\n**Ways of doing Error Control :** There are basically two ways of doing Error control as given below :\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200722235856/cvf1.png)\n\nWays of Error Control\n\n1. **Error Detection :** Error detection, as the name suggests, simply means detection or identification of errors. These errors may occur due to noise or any other impairments during transmission from transmitter to the receiver, in communication system. It is a class of techniques for detecting garbled i.e. unclear and distorted data or messages.\n2. **Error Correction :** Error correction, as the name suggests, simply means correction or solving or fixing of errors. It simply means reconstruction and rehabilitation of original data that is error-free. But error correction method is very costly and very hard.\n\n**Various Techniques for Error Control :** There are various techniques of error control as given below :\n\n**1\\.** [**Stop-and-Wait ARQ**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stop-and-wait-arq/) **:** Stop-and-Wait ARQ is also known as alternating bit protocol. It is one of the simplest flow and error control techniques or mechanisms. This mechanism is generally required in telecommunications to transmit data or information between two connected devices. Receiver simply indicates its readiness to receive data for each frame. In these, sender sends information or data packets to receiver. Sender then stops and waits for ACK (Acknowledgment) from receiver. Further, if ACK does not arrive within given time period i.e., time-out, sender then again resends frame and waits for ACK. But, if sender receives ACK, then it will transmit the next data packet to receiver and then again wait for ACK from receiver. This process to stop and wait continues until sender has no data frame or packet to send.\n\n**2\\.** [**Sliding Window ARQ**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-1/) **:** This technique is generally used for continuous transmission error control. It is further categorized into two categories as given below :\n\n- [**Go-Back-N ARQ**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-2-receiver-side/) **:** Go-Back-N ARQ is form of ARQ protocol in which transmission process continues to send or transmit total number of frames that are specified by window size even without receiving an ACK (Acknowledgement) packet from the receiver. It uses sliding window flow control protocol. If no errors occur, then operation is identical to sliding window.\n- [**Selective Repeat ARQ**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-3-selective-repeat/) **:** Selective Repeat ARQ is also form of ARQ protocol in which only suspected or damaged or lost data frames are only retransmitted. This technique is similar to Go-Back-N ARQ though much more efficient than the Go-Back-N ARQ technique due to reason that it reduces number of retransmission. In this, the sender only retransmits frames for which NAK is received. But this technique is used less because of more complexity between sender and receiver and each frame must be needed to be acknowledged individually.\n\nThe main difference between Go Back ARQ and Selective Repeat ARQ is that in Go Back ARQ, the sender has to retransmit the whole window of frame again if any of the frame is lost but in Selective Repeat ARQ only the data frame that is lost is retransmitted.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flow-control-in-data-link-layer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Flow Control in Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flow-control-in-data-link-layer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n34\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n- [sliding-window](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/sliding-window/?ref=article_tag)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [sliding-window](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=sliding-window&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

It is a technique that generally observes the proper flow of data from sender to receiver. It is very essential because it is possible for sender to transmit data or information at very fast rate and hence receiver can receive this information and process it. This can happen only if receiver has very high load of traffic as compared to sender, or if receiver has power of processing less as compared to sender. Flow control is basically a technique that gives permission to two of stations that are working and processing at different speeds to just communicate with one another. Flow control in Data Link Layer simply restricts and coordinates number of frames or amount of data sender can send just before it waits for an acknowledgement from receiver. Flow control is actually set of procedures that explains sender about how much data or frames it can transfer or transmit before data overwhelms receiver. The receiving device also contains only limited amount of speed and memory to store data. This is why receiving device should be able to tell or inform the sender about stopping the transmission or transferring of data on temporary basis before it reaches limit. It also needs buffer, large block of memory for just storing data or frames until they are processed.\n\nflow control can also be understand as a speed matching mechanism for two stations.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200722131021/ghg.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200722131021/ghg.png)\n\n**Approaches to Flow Control :** Flow Control is classified into two categories:\n\n- **Feedback \u2013 based Flow Control :** In this control technique, sender simply transmits data or information or frame to receiver, then receiver transmits data back to sender and also allows sender to transmit more amount of data or tell sender about how receiver is processing or doing. This simply means that sender transmits data or frames after it has received acknowledgements from user.\n- **Rate \u2013 based Flow Control :** In this control technique, usually when sender sends or transfer data at faster speed to receiver and receiver is not being able to receive data at the speed, then mechanism known as built-in mechanism in protocol will just limit or restricts overall rate at which data or information is being transferred or transmitted by sender without any feedback or acknowledgement from receiver.\n\n**Techniques of Flow Control in Data Link Layer :** There are basically two types of techniques being developed to control the flow of data\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200722131044/ghg1.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200722131044/ghg1.png)\n\n**1\\. Stop-and-Wait Flow Control :** This method is the easiest and simplest form of flow control. In this method, basically message or data is broken down into various multiple frames, and then receiver indicates its readiness to receive frame of data. When acknowledgement is received, then only sender will send or transfer the next frame. This process is continued until sender transmits EOT (End of Transmission) frame. In this method, only one of frames can be in transmission at a time. It leads to inefficiency i.e. less productivity if propagation delay is very much longer than the transmission delay and Ultimately \u00a0In this method sender sent single frame and receiver \u00a0take one frame at a time and sent acknowledgement(which is next frame number only) for new frame.\n\n**Advantages \u2013**\n\n- This method is very easiest and simple and each of the frames is checked and acknowledged well.\n- This method is also very accurate.\n\n**Disadvantages \u2013**\n\n- This method is fairly slow.\n- In this, only one packet or frame can be sent at a time.\n- It is very inefficient and makes the transmission process very slow.\n\n**2\\. Sliding Window Flow Control :** This method is required where reliable in-order delivery of packets or frames is very much needed like in data link layer. It is point to point protocol that assumes that none of the other entity tries to communicate until current data or frame transfer gets completed. In this method, sender transmits or sends various frames or packets before receiving any acknowledgement. In this method, both the sender and receiver agree upon total number of data frames after which acknowledgement is needed to be transmitted. Data Link Layer requires and uses this method that simply allows sender to have more than one unacknowledged packet \u201cin-flight\u201d at a time. This increases and improves network throughput. and Ultimately \u00a0In this method sender sent multiple frame but \u00a0receiver \u00a0take one by one and \u00a0after completing one frame acknowledge(which is next frame number only) for new frame.\n\n**Advantages \u2013**\n\n- It performs much better than stop-and-wait flow control.\n- This method increases efficiency.\n- Multiples frames can be sent one after another.\n\n**Disadvantages \u2013**\n\n- The main issue is complexity at the sender and receiver due to the transferring of multiple frames.\n- The receiver might receive data frames or packets out the sequence.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-control-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Access Control in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-control-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n52\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

The stop-and-wait\u00a0ARQ is used for noisy channels or links to handle flow and error control between sender and receiver. The Stop and Wait ARQ protocol sends a data frame and then waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.\n\n## What is Stop and Wait ARQ?\n\nThe Stop and Wait ARQ protocol sends a data frame and then waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver. The ACK indicates that the receiver successfully received the data frame. After receiving the ACK from the receiver, the sender delivers the next data frame. So there is a stop before the next data frame is transferred, hence it is known as the Stop and Wait ARQ protocol.\n\n## Characteristics of Stop and Wait ARQ\n\n- Used in [Connection-oriented communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connection-oriented-service/).\n- It offers error and flow control.\n- It is used in [Data Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/) and [Transport Layers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-responsibilities/)\n- Stop and Wait for ARQ mainly implements the Sliding Window Protocol concept with Window Size 1\n- It uses a link between sender and receiver as a half-duplex link\n- Throughput = 1 Data\u00a0packet/frame per\u00a0 RTT\n- If the bandwidth\\*Delay product is very high, then they stop and wait for protocol if it is not so useful. The sender has to keep waiting for acknowledgments before sending the processed next packet.\n- It is an example of \u201c **Closed Loop OR connection-oriented**\u201c protocols\n- It is a special category of SWP where its window size is 1\n- Irrespective of the number of packets sender is having stop and wait for protocol\u00a0 requires only\u00a0 2 sequence numbers 0 and 1\n\n## Useful Terms in Stop and Wait Protocol\n\n- **Propagation Delay:** Amount of time taken by a packet to make a physical journey from one router to another [router.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/)\n\n> [Propagation Delay](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/propagation-delay/) = (Distance between routers) / (Velocity of propagation)\n\n- [RoundTripTime ( **RTT**)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-rttround-trip-time/) = Amount of time taken by a packet to reach the receiver + Time taken by the Acknowledgement to reach the sender\n- TimeOut ( **TO**) =\u00a0 2\\* RTT\n- [Time To Live ( **TTL**)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-time-to-live-ttl/) = 2\\* TimeOut. (Maximum TTL is 255 seconds)\n\n## Simple Stop and Wait\n\n#### At Sender\n\n- Rule 1: Send one data packet at a time.\n- Rule 2: Send the next packet only after receiving acknowledgment for the previous.\n\n#### At Receiver\n\n- Rule 1: Send acknowledgement after receiving and consuming a data packet.\n- Rule 2: After consuming packet acknowledgement need to be sent [(Flow Control)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flow-control-in-data-link-layer/)\n\n\n![Stop and Wait](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ.png)\n\n## Problems Associated with Stop and Wait\n\n### **1\\. Lost Data**\n\nAssume the sender transmits the data packet and it is lost. The receiver has been waiting for the data for a long time. Because the data is not received by the receiver, it does not transmit an acknowledgment. The sender does not receive an acknowledgment, it will not send the next packet. This problem is caused by a loss of data.\n\n![Lost Data](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-2.png)\n\n### **2\\. Lost Acknowledgement**\n\nAssume the sender sends the data, which is also received by the receiver. The receiver sends an acknowledgment after receiving the packet. In this situation, the acknowledgment is lost in the network. The sender does not send the next data packet because it does not receive acknowledgement, under the stop and wait protocol, the next packet cannot be transmitted until the preceding packet\u2019s acknowledgment is received.\n\n![Lost Acknoeledgement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-3.png)\n\n### **3.\u00a0Delayed Acknowledgement/Data**\n\nAssume the sender sends the data, which is also received by the receiver. The receiver then transmits the acknowledgment, which is received after the sender\u2019s timeout period. After a timeout on the sender side, a long-delayed acknowledgement might be wrongly considered as acknowledgement of some other recent packet.\n\n## Stop and Wait for ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request)\n\nThe above 3 problems are resolved by Stop and Wait for ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) that does both [error control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-control-in-data-link-layer/) and flow control.\n\n![Stop and Wait ARQ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-4.png)\n\n### **1\\. Time Out**\n\nTimeout refers to the duration for which the sender waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver after transmitting a data packet. If the sender does not receive an ACK within this timeout period, it assumes that the frame was lost or corrupted and retransmits the frame.\n\n![Time Out](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-5.png)\n\n### **2\\. Sequence Number (Data)**\n\nIn Stop-and-Wait ARQ, the sender assigns sequence numbers to each data frame it sends. This allows the receiver to identify and acknowledge each frame individually, ensuring reliable delivery of data packets. After sending a frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next frame.\n\n![Sequence number for data](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-6.png)\n\n### **3.\u00a0Sequence Number(Acknowledgement)**\n\nSimilarly, sequence numbers are also used in acknowledgments (ACKs) sent by the receiver to acknowledge received data frames. When the receiver successfully receives a data frame, it sends an ACK back to the sender, indicating the sequence number of the next expected frame. The sender uses this ACK to determine whether the transmission was successful and whether it can proceed to send the next frame.\n\n## Working of Stop and Wait for ARQ\n\n- Sender A sends a data frame or packet with sequence number 0.\n- Receiver B, after receiving the data frame, sends an acknowledgement with sequence number 1 (the sequence number of the next expected data frame or packet)\n\nThere is only a one-bit sequence number that implies that both sender and receiver have a buffer for one frame or packet only.\n\n![Working Stop and Wait ARQ ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-7.png)\n\n## **Constraints in Stop and Wait ARQ**\n\nStop and Wait ARQ has very less efficiency , it can be improved by increasing the window size. Also , for better efficiency , [Go back N](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-2-receiver-side/) and [Selective Repeat Protocols](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-3-selective-repeat/) are used. The Stop and Wait ARQ solves the main three problems but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgement even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection). To solve this problem, we can send more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number. We will be discussing these protocols in the next articles.\u00a0So Stop and Wait ARQ may work fine where propagation delay is very less for example [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) connections but performs badly for distant connections like satellite connections.\n\n## **Advantages of Stop and Wait ARQ**\n\n- **Simple Implementation:** Stop and Wait ARQ is a simple protocol that is easy to implement in both hardware and software. It does not require complex algorithms or hardware components, making it an inexpensive and efficient option.\n- **Error Detection:** Stop and Wait ARQ detects errors in the transmitted data by using checksums or [cyclic redundancy checks (CRC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-2-binary-division/). If an error is detected, the receiver sends a negative acknowledgment (NAK) to the sender, indicating that the data needs to be retransmitted.\n- **Reliable:** Stop and Wait ARQ ensures that the data is transmitted reliably and in order. The receiver cannot move on to the next data packet until it receives the current one. This ensures that the data is received in the correct order and eliminates the possibility of data corruption.\n- **Flow Control:** Stop and Wait ARQ can be used for flow control, where the receiver can control the rate at which the sender transmits data. This is useful in situations where the receiver has limited buffer space or processing power.\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Stop and Wait ARQ is compatible with many existing systems and protocols, making it a popular choice for communication over unreliable channels.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Stop and Wait ARQ**\n\n- **Low Efficiency:** Stop and Wait ARQ has low efficiency as it requires the sender to wait for an acknowledgment from the receiver before sending the next data packet. This results in a low [data transmission rate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-transfer-rate/), especially for large data sets.\n- **High Latency:** Stop and Wait ARQ introduces additional latency in the transmission of data, as the sender must wait for an acknowledgment before sending the next packet. This can be a problem for real-time applications such as video streaming or online gaming.\n- **Limited Bandwidth Utilization:** Stop and Wait ARQ does not utilize the available bandwidth efficiently, as the sender can transmit only one data packet at a time. This results in underutilization of the channel, which can be a problem in situations where the available bandwidth is limited.\n- **Limited Error Recovery:** Stop and Wait ARQ has limited error recovery capabilities. If a data packet is lost or corrupted, the sender must retransmit the entire packet, which can be time-consuming and can result in further delays.\n- **Vulnerable to Channel Noise:** Stop and Wait ARQ is vulnerable to channel noise, which can cause errors in the transmitted data. This can result in frequent retransmissions and can impact the overall efficiency of the protocol.\n\n## Question For Practice\n\n**Question:** Suppose two hosts are connected by a point-to-point link and they are configured to use Stop and Wait protocol for reliable data transfer. Identify in which one of the following scenarios, the utilization of the link is the lowest. **\\[GATE CS/IT 2023\\]**\n\n(A) Longer link length and lower transmission rate\n\n(B) Longer link length and higher transmission rate\n\n(C) Shorter link length and lower transmission rate\n\n(D) Shorter link length and higher transmission rate\n\n> **Solution:** Correct option is (A)\n>\n> **Explanation-** Link utilization depends on **propagation delay** and **transmission rate**.\n>\n> - **Longer link length** increases **propagation delay**, reducing efficiency.\n> - **Lower transmission rate** increases **waiting time**, further reducing efficiency.\n>\n> Thus, the **lowest utilization** occurs when the **link is long and the transmission rate is low**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom the above discussion we can conclude that the Stop and Wait ARQ is useful for point-to-point delivery and offers connection-oriented transmission along with flow and error control. It is mainly used in the transport layer and is reliable.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Stop and Wait ARQ \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **When is Stop-and-Wait ARQ used?**\n\n> This ensures that the data is received in the correct order and prevents data corruption. Stop and Wait ARQ can be used for flow control, with the receiver controlling the rate at which the sender delivers data.\n\n### What is the efficiency of the Stop-and-Wait ARQ?\n\n> Stop and Wait ARQ has low efficiency because it needs the sender to wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver before sending the next data packet. This causes a low data transfer rate.\n\n### At which Layer Stop-and-Wait ARQ operates?\n\n> Stop and Wait ARQ operates at Data Link Layer of the OSI Model.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-3-selective-repeat/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Sliding Window Protocol \\| Set 3 (Selective Repeat)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-3-selective-repeat/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n106\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

There are two types of sliding window protocol **Go-Back-N (GBN)**, and Selective Repeat (SR).\n\nIn **Go-Back-N**, the sender can send multiple data packets without waiting for an acknowledgement for each one. However, it can only send a certain number of packets (this is called the \u201cwindow size\u201d). If one packet is lost or not acknowledged, the sender must go back and resend that packet _and_ all the packets that followed it, even if they were received correctly. For example, if packets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are sent and packet 3 gets lost, the sender will have to resend packets 3, 4, and 5, even if 4 and 5 were received. In this article, we will discuss the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol in detail.\n\n## What is the Go Back N (GBN) Protocol?\n\nThe Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol is a sliding window protocol used in networking for reliable data transmission. It is part of the Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols, which ensure that data is correctly received and that any lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted.\n\n**The three main characteristic features of GBN are:**\n\n### **1\\. Sender Window Size (W** ****R**** **)**\n\nIt is N itself. If we say the protocol is GB10, then Ws = 10. N should be always greater than 1 in order to implement pipelining. For N = 1, it reduces to the [Stop and Wait protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stop-and-wait-arq/).\n\n```\nEfficiency Of GBN = N/(1+2a)\nwhere a = Tp/Tt\nTp=Propogation Delay\nTt=Transmission Delay of sender\n```\n\nWhat will be the efficiency if processing delay, queuing delay and transmission delay of acknowledgement is not zero.\n\n**Efficiency= N\\*(Useful time)/(Total Time)**\n\n> where, useful time=Tt\n\n**Total time=Tt+2\\*Tp+Pr+Pq+Tt(ack)**\n\n> where,\n>\n> **Tt** =Transmission delay of sender side\n>\n> **Tp** =Propogation Delay\n>\n> **Pr=** Processing Delay\n>\n> **Pq=** Queuing Delay\n>\n> **Tt(ack)** =Transmission Delay of Acknowledgement\n\nIf B is the bandwidth of the channel, then\n\n```\nEffective Bandwidth or Throughput\n = Efficiency * Bandwidth\n = (N/(1+2a)) * B\n```\n\n### **2\\. Receiver Window Size (W** ****R**** **)**\n\nIn the GB-N the receiver window size is one always. i.e. WR is always 1 in GBN.\n\n### **3\\. Acknowledgements**\n\nIn flow control, acknowledgments (ACKs) are signals sent by the receiver to the sender to confirm that data packets have been successfully received. When the sender transmits data, it waits for an acknowledgment before sending more. This process helps ensure that data is received correctly. If an acknowledgment isn\u2019t received within a certain time, the sender assumes the packet was lost and retransmits it.\n\nThere are 2 kinds of acknowledgements namely:\n\n- **Cumulative Ack**: One acknowledgement is used for many packets. The main advantage is traffic is less. A disadvantage is less reliability as if one ack is the loss that would mean that all the packets sent are lost.\n- **Independent Ack**: If every packet is going to get acknowledgement independently then the reliability is high here but a disadvantage is that traffic is also high since for every packet we are receiving independent ack.\n\n## Working of GB-N Protocol\n\nNow what exactly happens in GBN, we will explain with a help of example. Consider the diagram given below. We have sender window size of 4. Assume that we have lots of sequence numbers just for the sake of explanation. Now the sender has sent the packets 0, 1, 2 and 3. After acknowledging the packets 0 and 1, receiver is now expecting packet 2 and sender window has also slided to further transmit the packets 4 and 5. Now suppose the packet 2 is lost in the network, Receiver will discard all the packets which sender has transmitted after packet 2 as it is expecting sequence number of 2.\n\nOn the sender side for every packet send there is a time out timer which will expire for packet number 2. Now from the last transmitted packet 5 sender will go back to the packet number 2 in the current window and transmit all the packets till packet number 5. That\u2019s why it is called Go Back N. Go back means sender has to go back N places from the last transmitted packet in the unacknowledged window and not from the point where the packet is lost. ![Go Back N Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sliding_SET_2-1.jpg)\n\n## **Relationship Between Window Size and Sequence Numbers**\n\nThe **window size** and **sequence numbers** in a sliding window protocol, like Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat, are closely related.\n\n- The **window size** determines how many packets the sender can transmit without needing an acknowledgment. It\u2019s like a limit on how much data can be sent before the sender has to stop and wait for confirmation.\n- **Sequence numbers** are used to label packets so the receiver knows their order and can detect any missing packets.\n\nThe **window size** should be smaller than or equal to the range of available **sequence numbers**. If the window size is too large compared to the sequence number range, the receiver might get confused because the same sequence number could be reused before the first one is acknowledged. This would make it hard to know if a packet is new or a duplicate.\n\n```\nRelation between window size and sequence number is given by the formula:\nWs+WR<=ASN\nwhere Ws is sender window size and WR is receiver window size, and ASN is available sequence number.\nWs+1<=ASN  because WR=1 in GB-N protocol\nSo minimum sequence numbers required in GBN = N + 1\n\n```\n\n```\nBits Required in GBN = ceil(log2 (N + 1))\n\nThe extra 1 is required in order to\navoid the problem of duplicate packets\nas described below.\n```\n\n## **Example: Consider an Example of GB4.**\n\n- Sender window size is 4 therefore we require a minimum of 4 sequence numbers to label each packet in the window.\n- Now suppose receiver has received all the packets(0, 1, 2 and 3 sent by sender) and hence is now waiting for packet number 0 again (We can not use 4 here as we have only 4 sequence numbers available since N = 4).\n- Now suppose the cumulative ack for the above 4 packets is lost in the network.\n- On sender side, there will be timeout for packet 0 and hence all the 4 packets will be transmitted again.\n- Problem now is receiver is waiting for new set of packets which should have started from 0 but now it will receive the duplicate copies of the previously accepted packets.\n- In order to avoid this, we need one extra sequence number.\n- Now the receiver could easily reject all the duplicate packets which were starting from 0 because now it will be waiting for packet number 4 (We have added an extra sequence number now).\n\nThis is explained with the help of the illustrations below. **Trying with Sequence numbers 4.**![Go Back N Protocol Example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sliding_SET_2-3.jpg) **Now Trying with one extra Sequence Number.**![GB-4 Protocol - Example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sliding_SET_2-4.jpg)\n\nNow it is clear as to why we need an extra 1 bit in the GBN protocol.\n\n### Advantages of GBN Protocol\n\n- Simple to implement and effective for reliable communication.\n- Better performance than stop-and-wait protocols for error-free or low-error networks.\n\n### Disadvantages of GBN Protocol\n\n- Inefficient if errors are frequent, as multiple frames might need to be retransmitted unnecessarily.\n- Bandwidth can be wasted due to redundant retransmissions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Go-Back-N protocol is a practical and easy-to-understand method for reliable data transfer. It allows sending multiple packets at once, making it more efficient than simpler methods. However, if there are frequent errors in the network, GBN can become less efficient because it has to resend multiple packets, even if only one is lost. It\u2019s best used in networks where errors are rare, offering a good balance of reliability and performance.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Go Back N Protocol \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **How does the Go-Back-N protocol work?**\n\n> The sender can send up to `N` unacknowledged packets at a time (where `N` is the window size). If a packet is lost or corrupted, the sender retransmits that packet and all following packets, even if they were received correctly by the receiver.\n\n### **In what scenarios is Go-Back-N most effective?**\n\n> Go-Back-N is most effective in networks where errors are infrequent and the overhead of retransmitting multiple packets is minimal.\n\n### **Why is it called \u201cGo-Back-N\u201d?**\n\n> It\u2019s called \u201cGo-Back-N\u201d because when an error is detected, the sender \u201cgoes back\u201d to the sequence number of the last acknowledged packet and retransmits all subsequent packets up to `N` packets.\n\n### **What is the difference between Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat?**\n\n> In Go-Back-N, if a single packet is lost, all subsequent packets are retransmitted, whereas, in Selective Repeat, only the lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted, making Selective Repeat more efficient in networks with higher error rates.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signatures-certificates/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Digital Signatures and Certificates](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signatures-certificates/?ref=next_article)\n\nP\n\nPranjul Ahuja\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Karn's Algorithm For Optimizing TCP\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nKarn's approach solves the issue of obtaining accurate round-trip time estimates for messages while utilizing the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in computer networking.

An alternative strategy, the selective repeat protocol, is to allow the receiver to accept and buffer the frames following a damaged or lost one. Selective Repeat attempts to retransmit only those packets that are actually lost (due to errors) :\n\n- Receiver must be able to accept packets out of order.\n- Since receiver must release packets to higher layer in order, the receiver must be able to buffer some packets.\n\n**Retransmission requests :**\n\n- **Implicit \u2013** The receiver acknowledges every good packet, packets that are not ACKed before a time-out are assumed lost or in error.Notice that this approach must be used to be sure that every packet is eventually received.\n- **Explicit \u2013** An explicit NAK (selective reject) can request retransmission of just one packet. This approach can expedite the retransmission but is not strictly needed.\n- One or both approaches are used in practice.\n\n**Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) :** This protocol(SRP) is mostly identical to GBN protocol, except that buffers are used and the receiver, and the sender, each maintains a window of size. SRP works better when the link is very unreliable. Because in this case, retransmission tends to happen more frequently, selectively retransmitting frames is more efficient than retransmitting all of them. SRP also requires full-duplex link. backward acknowledgements are also in progress.\n\n- Sender\u2019s Windows ( Ws) = Receiver\u2019s Windows ( Wr).\n- Window size should be less than or equal to half the sequence number in SR protocol. This is to avoid packets being recognized incorrectly. If the size of the window is greater than half the sequence number space, then if an ACK is lost, the sender may send new packets that the receiver believes are retransmissions.\n- Sender can transmit new packets as long as their number is with W of all unACKed packets.\n- Sender retransmit un-ACKed packets after a timeout \u2013 Or upon a NAK if NAK is employed.\n- Receiver ACKs all correct packets.\n- Receiver stores correct packets until they can be delivered in order to the higher layer.\n- In Selective Repeat ARQ, the size of the sender and receiver window must be at most one-half of 2^m.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Sliding-Window-Protocol.jpg)\n\n**Figure \u2013** the sender only retransmits frames, for which a NAK is receivedEfficiency of Selective Repeat Protocol (SRP) is same as GO-Back-N\u2019s efficiency :\n\n```\nEfficiency = N/(1+2a)\nWhere a = Propagation delay / Transmission delay\nBuffers = N + N\nSequence number  = N(sender side)  + N  ( Receiver Side)\n\n\n```\n\nif \u00a0Tt(ack) :Transmission delay for acknowledgment , Tq: Queuing delay and \u00a0Tpro: Processing delay is mention\n\n_**We know that the Efficiency (?),**_\n\n_**=Useful time / Total cycle time**_\n\n_**=Tt(data) /Tt(data) + 2\\*Tp + Tq + Tpro + Tt(ack)**_\n\n```\nTt(data) : Transmission delay for Data packet\nTp : propagation delay for Data packet\nTq: Queuing delay\nTpro: Processing delay\nTt(ack): Transmission delay for acknowledgment\n```\n\nAbove formula is applicable for any condition, if any of the things are not given we assume it to be 0.\n\n**References \u2013** [Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/manushadilan/selective-repeat-protocol-49828840) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oipm5DdYYAs) [MIT article](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-36-communication-systems-engineering-spring-2009/lecture-notes/MIT16_36s09_lec18.pdf) <\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piggybacking-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Piggybacking in Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piggybacking-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

The receiver waits until its network layer moves to the next data packet. Acknowledgment is associated with this outgoing data frame. Thus the acknowledgment travels along with the next data frame.\n\nIn this article, we will cover the overview of networking communication and mainly focus on the concept of piggybacking in networks. We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using piggybacking in networks. Finally, we will see the conclusion. Let\u2019s discuss them one by one.\n\n## **Networking Communication**\n\n[Sliding window algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/) are methods of flow control for network data transfer. The [data link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/) uses a sender to have more than one acknowledgment packet at a time, which improves network throughput. Both the sender and receiver maintain a finite-size buffer to hold outgoing and incoming packets from the other side. Every packet sent by the sender must be acknowledged by the receiver. The sender maintains a timer for every packet sent, and any packet unacknowledged at a certain time is resent. The sender may send a whole window of packets before receiving an acknowledgment for the first packet in the window. This results in higher transfer rates, as the sender may send multiple packets without waiting for each packet\u2019s acknowledgment. The receiver advertises a window size that tells the sender not to fill up the receiver buffers.\n\n## How To Increase Network Efficiency?\n\nEfficiency can also be improved by making use of the Full-duplex transmission mode. [Full Duplex transmission](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transmission-modes-computer-networks/) is a two-way directional communication simultaneously which means that it can communicate in both directions, just like we are using two half-duplex transmission nodes. It provides better performance than simple transmission modes and half-duplex transmission modes.\n\n![Full Duplex Transmission](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230331125521/Full-Duplex-transmission.png)\n\nFull Duplex Transmission\n\n## Why Piggybacking?\n\nEfficiency can also be improved by making use of full-duplex transmission. Full Duplex transmission is a transmission that happens with the help of two half-duplex transmissions which helps in communication in both directions. Full Duplex Transmission is better than both simplex and half-duplex transmission modes.\n\nThere are two ways through which we can achieve full-duplex transmission:\n\n1\\. **Two Separate Channels:** One way to achieve full-duplex transmission is to have two separate channels with one for forwarding data transmission and the other for reverse data transfer (to accept). But this will almost completely waste the bandwidth of the reverse channel.\n\n**2\\. Piggybacking:** A preferable solution would be to use each channel to transmit the frame (front and back) both ways, with both channels having the same capacity. Assume that A and B are users. Then the data frames from A to B are interconnected with the acknowledgment from A to B. and can be identified as a data frame or acknowledgment by checking the sort field in the header of the received frame.\n\nOne more improvement can be made. When a data frame arrives, the receiver waits and does not send the control frame \u00a0(acknowledgment) back immediately. The receiver waits until its network layer moves to the next data packet.\n\nAcknowledgment is associated with this outgoing data frame. Thus the acknowledgment travels along with the next data frame.\n\n## **Working of Piggybacking**\n\n![Working of Piggybacking](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230331125324/piggybacking.png)\n\nWorking of Piggybacking\n\nAs we can see in the figure, we can see with piggybacking, a single message (ACK + DATA) \u00a0over the wire in place of two separate messages. Piggybacking improves the efficiency of the bidirectional protocols.\n\n- If Host A has both acknowledgment and data, which it wants to send, then the data frame will be sent with the ack field which contains the sequence number of the frame.\n- If Host A contains only one acknowledgment, then it will wait for some time, then in the case, if it finds any data frame, it piggybacks the acknowledgment, otherwise, it will send the ACK frame.\n- If Host A left with only a data frame, then it will add the last acknowledgment to it. Host A can send a data frame with an ack field containing no acknowledgment bit.\n\n## **Advantages of Piggybacking**\n\n1. The major advantage of piggybacking is the better use of available channel bandwidth. This happens because an acknowledgment frame does not need to be sent separately.\n2. Usage cost reduction.\n3. Improves latency of data transfer.\n4. To avoid the delay and rebroadcast of frame transmission, piggybacking uses a very short-duration timer.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Piggybacking**\n\n1. The disadvantage of piggybacking is the additional complexity.\n2. If the data link layer waits long before transmitting the acknowledgment (blocks the ACK for some time), the frame will rebroadcast.\n\n## Piggybacking in Computer Networks -FAQ\u2019s\n\n### **How does Piggybacking improve efficiency?**\n\n> By combining an acknowledgment with outgoing data, piggybacking reduces the need for sending separate acknowledgment frames. This saves bandwidth, reduces the number of frames transmitted, and improves overall network efficiency.\n\n### **Does Piggybacking work in half-duplex communication?**\n\n> No, piggybacking is most effective in **full-duplex communication** where data can flow in both directions simultaneously. In half-duplex, the channel alternates between sending and receiving, so piggybacking provides no advantage.\n\n### **Why is Piggybacking not always used?**\n\n> Piggybacking may not be suitable when:\n>\n> - The data flow is not symmetric, and one device has no outgoing data to combine with an acknowledgment.\n> - Real-time acknowledgment is required to avoid delays, as waiting for outgoing data could increase latency.\n\n### **What happens if no data is available to piggyback an acknowledgment?**\n\n> If no outgoing data is available to piggyback an acknowledgment, the protocol imposes a **timeout**. Once the timeout expires, a separate acknowledgment frame is sent to avoid delays.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is IPv4?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/vkhwd2zylx669pl52nzr)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tanushree_dev/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[tanushree\\_dev](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tanushree_dev/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n34\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It is a set of specifications that are used for the implementation of the data link layer just above the physical layer of the [Open System Interconnections (OSI) Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/osi-full-form/).\n\nVarious data link protocols are required for [Wide Area Network (WAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wan-full-form/) and modem connections. Logical Link Control ( [LLC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-link-control-llc-protocol-data-unit/)) is a Local Area Network ( [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/)) data link protocol. Some of the data link protocols are given below :\n\n![data link protocols](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200802225857/D.png)\n\n**1\\. Synchronous Data Link Control (** [**SDLC**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sdlc-types-and-topologies/) **) \u2013** SDLC is basically a communication protocol of computer. It usually supports multipoint links even error recovery or error correction also. It is usually used to carry SNA (Systems Network Architecture) traffic and is present precursor to HDLC. It is also designed and developed by IBM in 1975. It is also used to connect all of the remote devices to mainframe computers at central locations may be in point-to-point (one-to-one) or point-to-multipoint (one-to-many) connections. It is also used to make sure that the data units should arrive correctly and with right flow from one network point to next network point.\n\n**2\\. High-Level Data Link Protocol (** [**HDLC**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-frame-structure-of-hdlc/) **) \u2013** HDLC is basically a protocol that is now assumed to be an umbrella under which many Wide Area protocols sit. It is also adopted as a part of X.25 network. It was originally created and developed by ISO in 1979. This protocol is generally based on SDLC. It also provides best-effort unreliable service and also reliable service. HDLC is a bit-oriented protocol that is applicable for point-to-point and multipoint communications both.\n\n**3\\. Serial Line Interface Protocol (** [**SLIP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slip-full-form/) **) \u2013** SLIP is generally an older protocol that is just used to add a framing byte at end of IP packet. It is basically a data link control facility that is required for transferring IP packets usually among Internet Service Providers (ISP) and a home user over a dial-up link. It is an encapsulation of the TCP/IP especially designed to work with over serial ports and several router connections simply for communication. It is some limitations like it does not provide mechanisms such as error correction or error detection.\n\n**4\\. Point to Point Protocol (** [**PPP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ppp-full-form/) **) \u2013** PPP is a protocol that is basically used to provide same functionality as SLIP. It is most robust protocol that is used to transport other types of packets also along with IP Packets. It can also be required for dial-up and leased router-router lines. It basically provides framing method to describe frames. It is a character-oriented protocol that is also used for error detection. It is also used to provides two protocols i.e. NCP and LCP. LCP is used for bringing lines up, negotiation of options, bringing them down whereas NCP is used for negotiating network-layer protocols. It is required for same serial interfaces like that of HDLC.\n\n**5\\. Link Control Protocol (LCP) \u2013** It was originally developed and created by IEEE 802.2. It is also used to provide HDLC style services on LAN ( [Local Area Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/)). LCP is basically a PPP protocol that is used for establishing, configuring, testing, maintenance, and ending or terminating links for transmission of data frames.\n\n**6\\. Link Access Procedure (** [**LAP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-access-procedure-lap-protocols/#:~:text=LAPF%20simply%20ensures%20that%20whether,specific%20do%20use%20this%20bit.&text=LAPX%20is%20basically%20used%20for%20ship%2Dto%2Dshore%20transmission.) **) \u2013** LAP protocols are basically a data link layer protocols that are required for framing and transferring data across point-to-point links. It also includes some reliability service features. There are basically three types of LAP i.e. LAPB (Link Access Procedure Balanced), LAPD (Link Access Procedure D-Channel), and LAPF (Link Access Procedure Frame-Mode Bearer Services). It is actually originated from IBM SDLC, which is being submitted by IBM to the ISP simply for standardization.\n\n7\\. **Network Control Protocol (** [**NCP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-control-protocol-ncp/#:~:text=Network%20Control%20Program%20(NCP)%20was,to%20pass%20messages%20between%20hosts.) **) \u2013** NCP was also an older protocol that was implemented by ARPANET. It basically allows users to have access to use computers and some of the devices at remote locations and also to transfer files among two or more computers. It is generally a set of protocols that is forming a part of PPP. NCP is always available for each and every higher-layer protocol that is supported by PPP. NCP was replaced by TCP/IP in the 1980s.\n\n## Examples of Data Link Layer Protocols -FAQ\u2019s\n\n### **What is the role of error detection in Data Link Layer protocols?**\n\n> Data Link Layer protocols include mechanisms like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection. These checks ensure that data transmitted between devices is error-free, and if errors are found, the data can be retransmitted.\n\n### **What is the purpose of Ethernet in the Data Link Layer?**\n\n> Ethernet is a widely-used protocol in LANs, facilitating communication between devices by packaging data into frames and ensuring error-free transmission. It operates on both the physical and Data Link layers, offering reliable, fast, and cost-effective network connections.\n\n### **What are the benefits of using Data Link Layer protocols?**\n\n> The benefits include improved reliability, error detection, efficient use of network resources, and smooth communication between devices. By ensuring data integrity and providing mechanisms like flow control and error correction, Data Link Layer protocols are essential for smooth and effective networking.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP/IP Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n23\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It is also used to connect all of the remote devices to mainframe computers at central locations may be in point-to-point (one-to-one) or point-to-multipoint (one-to-many) connections. It is also used to make sure that the data units should arrive correctly and with right flow from one network point to next network point.\n\n**2\\. High-Level Data Link Protocol (** [**HDLC**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-frame-structure-of-hdlc/) **) \u2013** HDLC is basically a protocol that is now assumed to be an umbrella under which many Wide Area protocols sit. It is also adopted as a part of X.25 network. It was originally created and developed by ISO in 1979. This protocol is generally based on SDLC. It also provides best-effort unreliable service and also reliable service. HDLC is a bit-oriented protocol that is applicable for point-to-point and multipoint communications both.\n\n**3\\. Serial Line Interface Protocol (** [**SLIP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/slip-full-form/) **) \u2013** SLIP is generally an older protocol that is just used to add a framing byte at end of IP packet. It is basically a data link control facility that is required for transferring IP packets usually among Internet Service Providers (ISP) and a home user over a dial-up link. It is an encapsulation of the TCP/IP especially designed to work with over serial ports and several router connections simply for communication. It is some limitations like it does not provide mechanisms such as error correction or error detection.\n\n**4\\. Point to Point Protocol (** [**PPP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ppp-full-form/) **) \u2013** PPP is a protocol that is basically used to provide same functionality as SLIP. It is most robust protocol that is used to transport other types of packets also along with IP Packets. It can also be required for dial-up and leased router-router lines. It basically provides framing method to describe frames. It is a character-oriented protocol that is also used for error detection. It is also used to provides two protocols i.e. NCP and LCP. LCP is used for bringing lines up, negotiation of options, bringing them down whereas NCP is used for negotiating network-layer protocols. It is required for same serial interfaces like that of HDLC.\n\n**5\\. Link Control Protocol (LCP) \u2013** It was originally developed and created by IEEE 802.2. It is also used to provide HDLC style services on LAN ( [Local Area Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/)). LCP is basically a PPP protocol that is used for establishing, configuring, testing, maintenance, and ending or terminating links for transmission of data frames.\n\n**6\\. Link Access Procedure (** [**LAP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-access-procedure-lap-protocols/#:~:text=LAPF%20simply%20ensures%20that%20whether,specific%20do%20use%20this%20bit.&text=LAPX%20is%20basically%20used%20for%20ship%2Dto%2Dshore%20transmission.) **) \u2013** LAP protocols are basically a data link layer protocols that are required for framing and transferring data across point-to-point links. It also includes some reliability service features. There are basically three types of LAP i.e. LAPB (Link Access Procedure Balanced), LAPD (Link Access Procedure D-Channel), and LAPF (Link Access Procedure Frame-Mode Bearer Services). It is actually originated from IBM SDLC, which is being submitted by IBM to the ISP simply for standardization.\n\n7\\. **Network Control Protocol (** [**NCP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-control-protocol-ncp/#:~:text=Network%20Control%20Program%20(NCP)%20was,to%20pass%20messages%20between%20hosts.) **) \u2013** NCP was also an older protocol that was implemented by ARPANET. It basically allows users to have access to use computers and some of the devices at remote locations and also to transfer files among two or more computers. It is generally a set of protocols that is forming a part of PPP. NCP is always available for each and every higher-layer protocol that is supported by PPP. NCP was replaced by TCP/IP in the 1980s.\n\n## Examples of Data Link Layer Protocols -FAQ\u2019s\n\n### **What is the role of error detection in Data Link Layer protocols?**\n\n> Data Link Layer protocols include mechanisms like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection. These checks ensure that data transmitted between devices is error-free, and if errors are found, the data can be retransmitted.\n\n### **What is the purpose of Ethernet in the Data Link Layer?**\n\n> Ethernet is a widely-used protocol in LANs, facilitating communication between devices by packaging data into frames and ensuring error-free transmission. It operates on both the physical and Data Link layers, offering reliable, fast, and cost-effective network connections.\n\n### **What are the benefits of using Data Link Layer protocols?**\n\n> The benefits include improved reliability, error detection, efficient use of network resources, and smooth communication between devices. By ensuring data integrity and providing mechanisms like flow control and error correction, Data Link Layer protocols are essential for smooth and effective networking.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP/IP Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n23\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

An IP address is a 32-bit unique address having an address space of 232.\n\n**Classful IP addressing** is a way of organizing and managing IP addresses, which are used to identify devices on a network. Think of IP addresses like street addresses for houses; each device on a network needs its unique address to communicate with other devices. In this article, we will discuss Classful IP addresses, and their types in detail.\n\n## Classful IP Addressing\n\nClassful IP addressing is an obsolete method for allocating IP addresses and dividing the available IP address space across networks. It was used from 1981 to 1993 until the introduction of [CIDR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr/) (Based on Prefixes rather than classes). Classful method categorizes IP addresses into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E), each defined by the first few bits of the address and serving specific ranges of purposes. The functionality of classful networking also extended to ease of configuration. Network administrators could set up networks with default subnet masks without the need for detailed subnetting strategies, which was particularly beneficial in less complex networking environments.\n\n### **IPV4 Address**\n\nAn **IPv4 address** is a unique number assigned to every device that connects to the internet or a computer network. It\u2019s like a home address for your computer, smartphone, or any other device, allowing it to communicate with other devices.\n\n- **Format**: An IPv4 address is written as four numbers separated by periods, like this: 192.168.1.1. Each number can range from 0 to 255.\n- The [IPv4 address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) is divided into two parts: **NID (Network ID)** = 8bit, and **HID (Host ID)** = 24bit. So there are 28 which is 256 total networks created and 224 which is 16M Host per network.\n- **Purpose**: The main purpose of an IPv4 address is to identify devices on a network and ensure that data sent from one device reaches the correct destination.\n- **Example**: When you type a website address into your browser, your device uses the IPv4 address to find and connect to the server where the website is hosted.\n\n**There are two notations in which the IP address is written, dotted decimal and hexadecimal notation.**\n\n### Dotted Decimal Notation\n\nSome points to be noted about dotted decimal notation:\n\n- The value of any segment (byte) is between 0 and 255 (both included).\n- No zeroes preceding the value in any segment (054 is wrong, 54 is correct).\n\n![Dotted Decimal Notation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_1.jpg)\n\nDotted Decimal Notation\n\n### Hexadecimal Notation\n\n![Hexadecimal Notation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620171208/1212.jpg)\n\n## Need For **Classful Addressing**\n\n- Classful addressing provided a straightforward method to allocate and manage IP addresses based on fixed classes, simplifying the administrative burden associated with IP address distribution.\n\n- Network equipment of the time, such as [routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/), could be more easily programmed to handle a limited number of fixed classes, speeding up the routing process because the class of an address could be quickly identified from its first few bits.\n\n- While it did have limitations, classful addressing allowed for scaling of networks within the bounds of each class size. Larger networks could use a Class A or B address, and smaller networks could operate efficiently within a Class C subnet.\n\n- By standardizing address ranges, classful addressing facilitated the implementation of uniform network protocols, which was important for the interoperability of network devices across different networks and platforms.\n\n- Classful addressing was a cost-effective solution that supported the early expansion of the [Internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet/) by avoiding the need for complex subnetting schemes that require additional computing resources and more sophisticated network management tools.\n\n## **Classes of IP Addressing**\n\nThe 32-bit IP address is divided into five sub-classes. These are given below:\n\n- Class A\n- Class B\n- Class C\n- Class D\n- Class E\n\nEach of these classes has a valid range of IP addresses. Classes D and E are reserved for multicast and experimental purposes respectively. The order of bits in the first octet determines the classes of the IP address.\n\nThe class of IP address is used to determine the bits used for network ID and host ID and the number of total networks and hosts possible in that particular class. Each [ISP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-service-provider-isp-hierarchy/) or network administrator assigns an IP address to each device that is connected to its network.\n\n![Classful Addressing ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_3.jpg)\n\nClassful Addressing\n\n**Note:**\n\n- IP addresses are globally managed by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and Regional Internet Registries (RIR).\n- While finding the total number of host IP addresses, 2 IP addresses are not counted and are therefore, decreased from the total count because the first IP address of any network is the network number and whereas the last IP address is reserved for broadcast IP.\n\n![Occupation of The Address Space In The Classful Addressing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240628132756/Screenshot-2024-06-28-132724.png)\n\nOccupation of The Address Space In Classful Addressing\n\n### Class A\n\nIP addresses belonging to class A are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts.\n\n- The network ID is 8 bits long.\n- The host ID is 24 bits long.\n\nThe higher-order bit of the first octet in class A is always set to 0. The remaining 7 bits in the first octet are used to determine network ID. The 24 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network. The default subnet mask for Class A is 255.x.x.x. Therefore, class A has a total of:\n\n- 224 \u2013 2 = 16,777,214 host ID\n\nIP addresses belonging to class A ranges from 0.0.0.0 \u2013 127.255.255.255.\n\n![Class A](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_4.jpg)\n\nClass A\n\n### Class B\n\nIP address belonging to class B is assigned to networks that range from medium-sized to large-sized networks.\n\n- The network ID is 16 bits long.\n- The host ID is 16 bits long.\n\nThe higher-order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class B are always set to 10. The remaining 14 bits are used to determine the network ID. The 16 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network. The default subnet mask for class B is 255.255.x.x. Class B has a total of:\n\n- 214 = 16384 network address\n- 216 \u2013 2 = 65534 host address\n\nIP addresses belonging to class B ranges from 128.0.0.0 \u2013 191.255.255.255.\n\n![Class B](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_5.jpg)\n\nClass B\n\n### Class C\n\nIP addresses belonging to class C are assigned to small-sized networks.\n\n- The network ID is 24 bits long.\n- The host ID is 8 bits long.\n\nThe higher-order bits of the first octet of IP addresses of class C is always set to 110. The remaining 21 bits are used to determine the network ID. The 8 bits of host ID are used to determine the host in any network. The default [subnet mask](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/role-of-subnet-mask/) for class C is 255.255.255.x. Class C has a total of:\n\n- 221 = 2097152 network address\n- 28 \u2013 2 = 254 host address\n\nIP addresses belonging to class C range from 192.0.0.0 \u2013 223.255.255.255.\n\n![Class C](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_6.jpg)\n\nClass C\n\n### Class D\n\nIP address belonging to class D is reserved for [multi-casting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multicasting-in-computer-network/). The higher-order bits of the first octet of IP addresses belonging to class D is always set to 1110. The remaining bits are for the address that interested hosts recognize.\n\nClass D does not possess any subnet mask. IP addresses belonging to class D range from 224.0.0.0 \u2013 239.255.255.255.\n\n![Class D](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_7.jpg)\n\nClass D\n\n### Class E\n\nIP addresses belonging to class E are reserved for experimental and research purposes. IP addresses of class E range from 240.0.0.0 \u2013 255.255.255.255. This class doesn\u2019t have any subnet mask. The higher-order bits of the first octet of class E are always set to 1111.\n\n![Class E](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_8.jpg)\n\nClass E\n\n## Range of Special IP Addresses\n\n```\n169.254.0.0 \u2013 169.254.0.16 : Link-local addresses\n127.0.0.0 \u2013 127.255.255.255 : Loop-back addresses\n0.0.0.0 \u2013 0.0.0.8: used to communicate within the current network.\n```\n\n## Rules for Assigning Host ID\n\nHost IDs are used to identify a host within a network. The host ID is assigned based on the following rules:\n\n- Within any network, the host ID must be unique to that network.\n- A host ID in which all bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned because this host ID is used to represent the network ID of the IP address.\n- Host ID in which all bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned because this host ID is reserved as a broadcast address to send packets to all the hosts present on that particular network.\n\n## Rules for Assigning Network ID\n\nHosts that are located on the same physical network are identified by the network ID, as all host on the same physical network is assigned the same network ID. The network ID is assigned based on the following rules:\n\n- The network ID cannot start with 127 because 127 belongs to the class A address and is reserved for internal loopback functions.\n- All bits of network ID set to 1 are reserved for use as an IP broadcast address and therefore, cannot be used.\n- All bits of network ID set to 0 are used to denote a specific host on the local network and are not routed and therefore, aren\u2019t used.\n\n## Structure of Classful Addressing\n\n![Summary of Classful addressing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2015/07/nethostdata.jpg)\n\nIn the above table No. of networks for class A should be 127. (Network ID with all 0 s is not considered)\n\n## Problems With Classful Addressing\n\nThe problem with this classful addressing method is that millions of class A addresses are wasted, many of the class B addresses are wasted, whereas, the number of addresses available in class C is so small that it cannot cater to the needs of organizations. Class D addresses are used for multicast routing and are therefore available as a single block only. Class E addresses are reserved.\n\nSince there are these problems, Classful networking was replaced by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993. We will be discussing Classless addressing in the next post.\n\n- The network ID is 24 bits long.\n- The host ID is 8 bits long.\n- 221 = 2097152 network address\n- 28 \u2013 2 = 254 host address\n- Within any network, the host ID must be unique to that network.\n- Host ID in which all bits are set to 0 cannot be assigned because this host ID is used to represent the [network ID](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-id-and-host-id-in-ip-addresses/) of the IP address.\n- Host ID in which all bits are set to 1 cannot be assigned because this host ID is reserved as a broadcast address to send packets to all the hosts present on that particular network.\n- The network ID cannot start with 127 because 127 belongs to the class A address and is reserved for internal loopback functions.\n- All bits of network ID set to 1 are reserved for use as an IP [broadcast address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-limited-broadcast-address/) and therefore, cannot be used.\n- All bits of network ID set to 0 are used to denote a specific host on the local network and are not routed and therefore, aren\u2019t used.\n\n## Classful and Classless Addressing\n\nHere is the main [difference between Classful and Classless Addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classful-vs-classless-addressing/):\n\n| **Parameter** | **Classful Addressing** | **Classless Addressing** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Basics** | In Classful addressing IP addresses are allocated according to the classes- A to E. | Classless addressing came to replace the classful addressing and to handle the issue of rapid exhaustion of IP addresses. |\n| **Practical** | It is less practical. | It is more practical. |\n| **Network ID and Host ID** | The changes in the\u00a0Network ID and Host ID\u00a0depend on the class. | There is no such restriction of class in classless addressing. |\n| **VLSM** | It does not support the Variable Length Subnet Mask ( [VLSM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/)). | It supports the Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM). |\n| **Bandwidth** | Classful addressing requires more bandwidth. As a result, it becomes slower and more expensive as compared to classless addressing. | It requires less bandwidth. Thus, fast and less expensive as compared to classful addressing. |\n| **CIDR** | It does not support\u00a0Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). | It supports Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). |\n| **Updates** | Regular or periodic updates | Triggered Updates |\n| **Troubleshooting and Problem detection** | Troubleshooting and problem detection are easy than classless addressing because of the division of network, host and subnet parts in the address. | It is not as easy compared to classful addressing. |\n| **Division of Address** | - Network<br>- Host\u00a0<br>- Subnet | - Host\u00a0<br>- Subnet |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nClassful IP addressing, with its categorization into classes like A, B, and C, was a fundamental method in early networking. It organized IP addresses based on network size but faced limitations in flexibility and efficient use of address space. The development of [CIDR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr/) addressed these issues by allowing more precise control over subnetting and optimizing address allocation.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Classful IP Addressing -FAQs\n\n### What is classful addressing in IP?\n\n> A **classful network** is an old way of organizing IP addresses on the Internet. It was used from 1981 until 1993 when a new system called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) replaced it. This method split IP addresses for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) into five classes based on the first four bits of the address.\n\n### What is classful and classless routing protocol?\n\n> Classful routing protocols, like RIP and IGRP, do not include subnet mask information in updates, assuming default classes (A, B, or C). Classless routing protocols, such as OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP, include subnet mask information, allowing more flexible IP address usage.\n\n### What is Class AB and C IP address?\n\n> Class A IP addresses (1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255) have a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 and are used for large networks. Class B addresses (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255) have a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 for medium-sized networks. Class C addresses (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255) have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 for small networks.\n\n### What is the subnet mask for a classful class a IP range?\n\n> The subnet mask for a classful Class A IP range is 255.0.0.0, with the first 8 bits for the network portion and the remaining 24 bits for the host portion.\n\n### **How does Classful IP Addressing handle subnetting?**\n\n> Classful IP addressing does not support subnetting in the way that Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) does. Each class has a fixed subnet mask, which limits the flexibility in dividing networks into smaller subnets.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-subnetting/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction To Subnetting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-subnetting/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n169\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

Therefore, the network address is 132.6.0.0.\n\n## **Subnetting**\n\nDividing a large block of addresses into several contiguous sub-blocks and assigning these sub-blocks to different smaller networks is called subnetting. It is a practice that is widely used when classless addressing is done.\n\nA subnet or subnetwork is a network inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.\n\n## **Classless Addressing**\n\nTo reduce the wastage of IP addresses in a block, we use sub-netting. What we do is that we use host id bits as net id bits of a classful IP address. We give the IP address and define the number of bits for mask along with it (usually followed by a \u2018/\u2019 symbol), like, 192.168.1.1/28. Here, subnet mask is found by putting the given number of bits out of 32 as 1, like, in the given address, we need to put 28 out of 32 bits as 1 and the rest as 0, and so, the subnet mask would be 255.255.255.240. A classless addressing system or classless interdomain routing (CIDR or supernetting) is the way to combine two or more class C networks to create a/23 or a /22 supernet. A classless addressing system or classless interdomain routing (CIDR) is an improved IP addressing system. In a classless addressing system the block of IP address is assigned dynamically based on specific rules.\n\n### **Some Values Calculated in Subnetting:**\n\n1\\. Number of subnets : 2(Given bits for mask \u2013 No. of bits in default mask)\n\n2\\. Subnet address : AND result of subnet mask and the given IP address\n\n3\\. Broadcast address : By putting the host bits as 1 and retaining the network bits as in the IP address\n\n4\\. Number of hosts per subnet : 2(32 \u2013 Given bits for mask) \u2013 2\n\n5\\. First Host ID : Subnet address + 1 (adding one to the binary representation of the subnet address)\n\n6\\. Last Host ID : Subnet address + Number of Hosts\n\n- C++\n- C\n- Python3\n- C#\n\n## C++\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`<br>`using` `namespace` `std;`<br>`string ip_classless(string ip){`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``// Extract the first octet as a string and then convert it to an int using stoi function `<br>`\u00a0\u00a0`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``int` `first_octet=stoi(ip.substr(0,ip.find(` `'.'` `)));`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``if` `(first_octet>=0 and first_octet<=127){`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``// Means the IP Address in Class A `<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``return` `ip+` `\"/8\"` `;`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``}`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``if` `(first_octet>=128 and first_octet<=191){`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``// Means the IP Address is in Class B`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``return` `ip+` `\"/16\"` `;`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``}`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``if` `(first_octet>=192 and first_octet<=223){`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``// Means the IP Address is in Class C`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``return` `ip+` `\"/24\"` `;`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``}`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``return` `\"Reserved IP Address.

The resulting CIDR notation is returned by the function ip\\_classless.\n\n```\nEnter an IP address in classful notation: 192.168.0.0\nClassless address: 192.168.0.0/24\n\n```\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Question:** **Given IP Address \u2013 172.16.0.0/25, find the number of subnets and the number of hosts per subnet. Also, for the first subnet block, find the subnet address, first host ID, last host ID, and broadcast address.**\n\n**Solution**:\n\n> This is a class B address. So, no. of subnets = 2(25-16) = 29 = 512.\n>\n> No. of hosts per subnet = 2(32-25) \u2013 2 = 27 \u2013 2 = 128 \u2013 2 = 126\n>\n> For the first subnet block(means Subnet Number=1), we have subnet address = 172.16.0.0, first host id = 172.16.0.1, last host id = 172.16.0.126 and broadcast address = 172.16.0.127\n\n## **G** ATE Previous Year Questions\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2003 \\| Question\u00a082](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2003-question-82/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2006 \\| Question\u00a045](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2006-question-45/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2007 \\| Question\u00a067](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2007-question-67/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2008 \\| Question\u00a057](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2008-question-57/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2010 \\| Question\u00a047](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2010-question-47/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2012 \\| Question\u00a021](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2012-question-23/)\n\n[GATE \\| GATE CS 2015 Set 3 \\| Question\u00a048](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2015-set-3-question-48/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classful-vs-classless-addressing/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Classful vs Classless Addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classful-vs-classless-addressing/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n66\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

For you to send a letter to a friend living in one of these houses, you need their home address. In the digital world, this home address is what we call an **IP (Internet Protocol) Address**. It\u2019s a unique string of numbers separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that identifies each device connected to the internet or a local network.\n\n**Here\u2019s the definition:**\n\n> ## What is an IP Address?\n>\n> An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique string of numbers assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier that allows devices to send and receive data over the network, ensuring that this data reaches the correct destination.\n\n## Types of IP Address\n\nIP addresses can be classified in several ways based on their structure, purpose, and the type of network they are used in. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the different classifications of IP addresses:\n\n## **1\\. Based on Addressing Scheme (IPv4 vs. IPv6)**\n\n### **IPv4:**\n\nThis is the most common form of IP Address. It consists of four sets of numbers separated by dots. For example, 192.158.1.38. Each set of numbers can range from 0 to 255. This format can support over 4 billion unique addresses. Here\u2019s how the structure is broken down:\n\n- **Four Octets**: Each octet represents eight bits, or a byte, and can take a value from 0 to 255. This range is derived from the possible combinations of eight bits (2^8 = 256 combinations).\n- **Example of IPv4 Address**: 192.168.1.1\n  - **192** is the first octet\n  - **168** is the second octet\n  - **1** is the third octet\n  - **1** is the fourth octet\n\nEach part of the IP address can indicate various aspects of the network configuration, from the network itself to the specific device within that network. In most cases, the network part of the address is represented by the first one to three octets, while the remaining section identifies the host (device).\n\n![IPv4-address-format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241217170153436945/IPv4-address-format.webp)\n\nIPv4 Address Format\n\n### **IPv6:**\n\nIPv6 addresses were created to deal with the shortage of IPv4 addresses. They use 128 bits instead of 32, offering a vastly greater number of possible addresses. These addresses are expressed as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons.\n\n- **Example of IPv6 Address**: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\n  - Each group (like **2001**, **0db8**, **85a3**, etc.) represents a 16-bit block of the address.\n\n> For detailed information, refer to this article \u2013 [**IPv4 vs. IPv6**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/)\n\n## **2\\. Based on Usage (Public vs. Private)**\n\n### Public IP Addresses\n\nA Public IP address is assigned to every device that directly accesses the internet. This address is unique across the entire internet. Here are the key characteristics and uses of public IP addresses:\n\n- **Uniqueness:** Each public IP address is globally unique. No two devices on the internet can have the same public IP address at the same time.\n- **Accessibility:** Devices with a public IP address can be accessed directly from anywhere on the internet, assuming no firewall or security settings block the access.\n- **Assigned by ISPs:** Public IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). When you connect to the internet through an ISP, your device or router receives a public IP address.\n- **Types:** Public IP addresses can be static (permanently assigned to a device) or dynamic (temporarily assigned and can change over time).\n\n> **Example Use:** Public IP addresses are typically used for servers hosting websites, email servers, or any device that needs to be accessible from the internet. For instance, if you host a website on your own server at home, your ISP must assign a public IP address to your server so users around the world can access your site.\n\n### Private IP Addresses\n\nPrivate IP addresses are used within private networks (such as home networks, office networks, etc.) and are not routable on the internet. This means that devices with private IP addresses cannot directly communicate with devices on the internet without a translating mechanism like a router performing Network Address Translation (NAT). Key features include:\n\n- **Not globally unique:** Private IP addresses are only required to be unique within their own network. Different private networks can use the same range of IP addresses without conflict.\n- **Local communication:** These addresses are used for communication between devices within the same network. They cannot be used to communicate directly with devices on the internet.\n- **Defined ranges:** The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved specific IP address ranges for private use:\n  - **IPv4:** 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255\n  - **IPv6:** Addresses starting with FD or FC\n\n> **Example Use:** In a typical home network, the router assigns private IP addresses to each device (like smartphones, laptops, smart TVs) from the reserved ranges. These devices use their private IPs to communicate with each other and with the router. The router uses NAT to allow these devices to access the internet using its public IP address.\n\n![Private-_-Public-Address](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241217170342121691/Private-_-Public-Address.webp)\n\n## **3\\. Based on Assignment Method (Static vs. Dynamic)**\n\n### **Static IP Addresses:**\n\n- These are permanently assigned to a device, typically important for servers or devices that need a constant address.\n- Reliable for network services that require regular access such as websites, remote management.\n\n### **Dynamic IP Addresses:**\n\n- Temporarily assigned from a pool of available addresses by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\n- Cost-effective and efficient for providers, perfect for consumer devices that do not require permanent addresses.\n\n> For detailed information, refer to this article \u2013 [**Static vs. Dynamic IP Address**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-ip-address/)\n\n## How Do IP Addresses Work?\n\nHere\u2019s how IP addresses work:\n\n### 1\\. **Unique Identification**\n\nEvery device connected to a network, such as computers, smartphones, and servers, is assigned an IP address. This address is used to identify the device on the network, similar to how a home address identifies a specific location.\n\n### 2\\. **Communication Protocol**\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP), part of the broader suite of internet protocols, uses these addresses to facilitate the routing of data packets between devices. Each piece of data sent over a network is broken into smaller units called packets. Each packet includes both the sender\u2019s and the recipient\u2019s IP addresses.\n\n### 3\\. **Data Routing**\n\nWhen a device sends information to another device over the internet:\n\n- The data is divided into packets.\n- Each packet contains the IP address of the device it is destined for.\n- Routers within the network read the destination IP address on each packet and determine the best path for the packet to travel. Routers communicate with each other to update and maintain records of the fastest, most efficient routes for data.\n\n### 4\\. **Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN)**\n\n- **LAN:** On local networks, IP addresses can be assigned manually by an administrator (static IP) or automatically by a DHCP server. Devices within the same network communicate directly using their local IP addresses.\n- **WAN:** For devices on different networks, the data must travel through multiple routers across the internet. Each router makes independent decisions about the best route for the packets based on the destination IP address.\n\n### 5\\. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**\n\nMost devices on a home or small business network share a single public IP address when accessing the internet, even though each device has its own private IP address within the local network. NAT is a process where multiple local IP addresses are mapped to a single public IP address. This conserves IP addresses and adds a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from the external network.\n\n## Real World Scenario: Sending an Email from New York to Tokyo\n\nLet\u2019s explore how IP addresses work through a real-world example that involves sending an email from one person to another across the globe:\n\n**Step 1: Assigning IP Addresses**\n\n- Alice in New York wants to send an email to Bob in Tokyo.\n- Alice\u2019s laptop has a private IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.5) assigned by her router at home.\n- Bob\u2019s computer in Tokyo has a private IP address (e.g., 192.168.2.4) assigned by his router at his office.\n\n**Step 2: Connection to the Internet**\n\n- Both Alice and Bob\u2019s routers have public IP addresses assigned by their Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These public IP addresses are what the devices use to send and receive data over the internet.\n\n**Step 3: Sending the Email**\n\n- Alice writes her email and hits send.\n- Her email service (e.g., Gmail) packages the message and its attachments into data packets. Each packet includes the source IP (Alice\u2019s router\u2019s public IP) and the destination IP (Bob\u2019s email server\u2019s public IP).\n\n**Step 4: Routing the Packets**\n\n- The data packets leave Alice\u2019s laptop and travel to her home router. The router notes that the destination IP is outside the local network.\n- The router sends the packets to Alice\u2019s ISP. The ISP uses routers that examine the destination IP address of the packets and determine the best route to send them toward their destination.\n- The packets may pass through several routers around the world \u2014 in data centers in countries like Canada, Germany, and finally Japan. Each router along the way reads the destination IP and forwards the packets accordingly.\n\n**Step 5: Reaching Bob**\n\n- The packets arrive at Bob\u2019s email server\u2019s ISP in Tokyo and are then forwarded to the server.\n- Bob\u2019s email server reassembles the packets into the original email message.\n\n**Step 6: Bob Accesses the Email**\n\n- Bob\u2019s computer requests the email from his server using his local network IP.\n- The server sends the email to Bob\u2019s computer, allowing him to read the message Alice sent.\n\n### Additional Details\n\n- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Both Alice and Bob\u2019s routers perform NAT, translating the private IP addresses to and from the public IP addresses when interfacing with the internet. This process is crucial for keeping the number of public IPs needed lower and adds a layer of security by masking internal network structures.\n- **Dynamic IP Addressing**: If either Alice or Bob\u2019s public IP is dynamic, it might change if they restart their routers. This doesn\u2019t affect their ongoing activities much because the DNS (Domain Name System) helps update the mapping of domain names (like gmail.com) to the current IP addresses.\n\nThis example illustrates the fundamental role of IP addresses and the complex network of routers involved in even the simplest internet activities like sending an email. Each part of the process depends on the IP address to ensure that data finds its way correctly from sender to receiver, no matter where they are in the world.\n\n## \u2014\\> Other Important Things to Know About IP Address\n\n## **Classes of IPv4 Address**\n\nThere are around 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses and managing all those addresses without any classification is next to impossible.\n\n_Let\u2019s understand it with a simple example. If you have to find a word from a language dictionary, how long will it take just think about it. Usually you will take less than 5 minutes to find that word. You are able to do this because words in the dictionary are organized in alphabetical order. If you have to find out the same word from a dictionary that doesn\u2019t use any sequence or order to organize the words, it will take an eternity to find the word. If a dictionary with one billion words without order can be so disastrous, then you can imagine the pain behind finding an address from 4.3 billion addresses._\n\nFor easier management and assignment IP addresses are organized in numeric order and divided into the following 5 classes:\n\n**IP addresses are also classified into different classes based on their range and intended use:**\n\n- **Class A** (1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255):\n  - Used for very large networks (like multinational companies).\n  - Supports up to 16 million hosts per network.\n  - **Example:** `10.0.0.1` (Private IP in this class).\n- **Class B** (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255):\n  - Used for medium-sized networks, such as large organizations.\n  - Supports up to 65,000 hosts per network.\n  - **Example:** `172.16.0.1` (Private IP in this class).\n- **Class C** (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255):\n  - Used for smaller networks, like small businesses or home networks.\n  - Supports up to 254 hosts per network.\n  - **Example:** `192.168.1.1` (Private IP in this class).\n- **Class D** (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255):\n  - Reserved for multicast groups (used to send data to multiple devices at once).\n  - Not used for traditional devices or networks.\n- **Class E** (240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255):\n  - Reserved for experimental purposes and future use.\n\n| IP Class | Address Range | Maximum number of networks |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class A | 1-126 | 126 (27-2) |\n| Class B | 128-191 | 16384 |\n| Class C | 192-223 | 2097152 |\n| Class D | 224-239 | Reserve for multitasking |\n| Class E | 240-254 | Reserved for Research and development |\n\n## **Special IP Addresses**\n\nThere are also some special-purpose IP addresses that don\u2019t follow the usual structure:\n\n- **Loopback Address**:\n  - The loopback address `127.0.0.1` is used to test network connectivity within the same device (i.e., sending data to yourself).\n  - Often called \u201clocalhost.\u201d\n- **Broadcast Address**:\n  - The broadcast address allows data to be sent to all devices in a network. For a typical network with the IP range `192.168.1.0/24`, the broadcast address would be `192.168.1.255`.\n- **Multicast Address**:\n  - Used to send data to a group of devices (multicast). For example, `233.0.0.1` is a multicast address.\n\n## **How to Look Up IP Addresses?**\n\n### In Windows\n\n1. Open the Command Prompt.\n2. Type **`ipconfig`** and press Enter.\n3. Look for your IP under your network connection.\n\n### On Mac\n\n1. Open System Preferences > Network.\n2. Select your active connection.\n3. You\u2019ll see your IP address in the connection details.\n\n### On iPhone\n\n1. Go to Settings > Wi-Fi.\n2. Tap the (i) icon next to your network.\n3. Find your IP under \u201cIP Address.\u201d\n\n## **IP Address Security Threats**\n\nIP addresses are essential for connecting devices on the internet, but they also come with various security risks. Understanding these threats can help you protect your network and personal information more effectively. Here are some common IP address security threats:\n\n- **IP Spoofing:** Hackers use this technique to bypass security measures, launch attacks, or gain unauthorized access to systems. By pretending to be a trusted IP address, attackers can trick networks into granting them access or allowing malicious activities.\n\n- **Distributed Denial of Service (** [**DDoS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/denial-of-service-ddos-attack/) **) Attacks:** This happens by overloading a website or service with too much traffic. Many hacked devices send lots of requests to a target all at once, making the website or service crash. This means real users can\u2019t access it which can cause crashing of site, businesses to lose money and many more.\n\n- **Man-in-the-Middle (** [**MitM**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-in-the-middle-attack-in-diffie-hellman-key-exchange/) **) Attacks:** Eavesdropping or altering messages between two people without letting them know is MitM attack. Attackers intercept the communication between two parties and can steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details by targeting the IP addresses involved.\n\n- **Port Scanning: It** is a technique used to identify open ports and services running on a device\u2019s IP address. Hackers use port scanners to find vulnerabilities in network services, which they can then exploit to gain unauthorized access or deploy malware. Regularly monitoring and securing open ports is essential to prevent such attacks.\n\n## **How to Protect and Hide Your IP Address?**\n\n- **VPN (** [**Virtual Private Network**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vpn-and-how-it-works/) **)**: A VPN hides your IP by masking it with the VPN server\u2019s IP, giving you privacy. Your internet traffic passes through the VPN server, masking your real IP address with the server\u2019s IP. This makes it difficult for others to track your online activities or identify your location.\n- **Proxy Server**: Routes your data through a different server, hiding your real IP. When you use a proxy, your requests go through the proxy server, which hides your real IP address by replacing it with its own.\n- **Tor Browser**: Encrypts and bounces your data around multiple servers for anonymity. This multi-layered routing makes it extremely difficult to trace your IP address or monitor your online activities.\n- **Enable Your Firewall:** A [firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/) is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.It can block unauthorized access to your device, making it harder for attackers to target your IP address.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIP addresses are essential for connecting devices over the internet. While they help identify and communicate with other devices, it\u2019s important to protect your IP to keep your information safe and private. IP addresses also come with challenges such as privacy risks and vulnerability to cyberattacks. Understanding both the benefits and drawbacks of IP addresses helps us appreciate their importance in the digital world while enabling the need for effective protection measures.\n\n## **What is an IP Address? \u2013 FAQs**\n\n### **What\u2019s the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?**\n\n> IPv4 is a shorter, older format; IPv6 is a longer, newer format to support more devices.\n\n### **Can I check my public IP?**\n\n> Yes, search \u201cWhat is my IP address\u201d on Google, or use an IP lookup website.\n\n### **Can someone track me through my IP?**\n\n> Yes, but using a VPN or proxy can help keep you private.\n\n### **Is it okay to hide my IP?**\n\n> Yes, hiding your IP is legal and helps protect your privacy.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethernet-frame-format/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Ethernet Frame Format](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethernet-frame-format/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/mr5iuyw7vw0dcnzuwrru)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/keshadi/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[keshadi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/keshadi/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Class 12](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/class-12/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-programming/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

IPv4 was the primary version brought into action for production within the ARPANET in 1983.\u00a0IP version four addresses are 32-bit integers which will be expressed in decimal notation.\u00a0In this article, we will discuss about IPv4 datagram header.\n\nIPv4 is a connectionless protocol used for packet-switched networks. [Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) is the fourth revision of the Internet Protocol and a widely used protocol in data communication over different kinds of networks. IPv4 is a connectionless protocol used in packet-switched layer networks, such as [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/). It provides a logical connection between network devices by providing identification for each device. There are many ways to configure IPv4 with all kinds of devices \u2013 including manual and automatic configurations \u2013 depending on the network type. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses for Ethernet communication in five classes: A, B, C, D and E. Classes A, B, and C have a different bit length for addressing the network host. Class D addresses are reserved for [multicasting,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multicasting-in-computer-network/) while class E addresses are reserved for military purposes. IPv4 uses 32-bit (4-byte) addressing, which gives 232 addresses. IPv4 addresses are written in the dot-decimal notation, which comprises four octets of the address expressed individually in decimal and separated by periods, for instance, 192.168.1.5.\n\n## Characteristics of IPv4\n\n- IPv4 could be a 32-Bit IP Address.\n- IPv4 could be a numeric address, and its bits are separated by a dot.\n- The number of header fields is twelve and the length of the header field is twenty.\n- It has Unicast, broadcast, and multicast style of addresses.\n- IPv4 supports [VLSM (Virtual Length Subnet Mask).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/)\n- IPv4 uses the Post Address Resolution Protocol to map to the [MAC address.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/)\n- [RIP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/) may be a routing protocol supported by the routed daemon.\n- Networks ought to be designed either manually or with [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/).\n- Packet fragmentation permits from routers and causing host.\n\n## IPv4 Datagram Header\n\n- **VERSION** _**:**_ Version of the IP protocol (4 bits), which is 4 for IPv4\n- **HLEN:** IP header length (4 bits), which is the number of 32 bit words in the header. The minimum value for this field is 5 and the maximum is 15.\n- **Type of service:** Low Delay, High Throughput, Reliability (8 bits)\n- **Total Length:** Length of header + Data (16 bits), which has a minimum value 20 bytes and the maximum is 65,535 bytes.\n- **Identification** _**:**_ Unique Packet Id for identifying the group of fragments of a single IP datagram (16 bits)\n- **Flags** _**:**_ 3 flags of 1 bit each : reserved bit (must be zero), do not fragment flag, more fragments flag (same order)\n- **Fragment Offset:** Represents the number of Data Bytes ahead of the particular fragment in the particular Datagram. Specified in terms of number of 8 bytes, which has the maximum value of 65,528 bytes.\n- **Time to live** _**:**_ Datagram\u2019s lifetime (8 bits), It prevents the datagram to loop through the network by restricting the number of Hops taken by a Packet before delivering to the Destination.\n- **Protocol:** Name of the protocol to which the data is to be passed (8 bits)\n- **Header Checksum** _**:**_ 16 bits header [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) for checking errors in the datagram header\n- **Source IP address** _**:**_ 32 bits IP address of the sender\n- **Destination IP address** _**:**_ 32 bits [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) of the receiver\n- **Option:** Optional information such as source route, record route. Used by the Network administrator to check whether a path is working or not.\n\n![IPv4-Datagram-Header](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240621133536/IPv4-Datagram-Header.jpg)\n\nIPv4 Datagram Header\n\nDue to the presence of options, the size of the datagram header can be of variable length (20 bytes to 60 bytes).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on IPv4 \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the size of IPv4 datagram?\n\n> **IPv4 Datagram Header** Size of the header is 20 to 60 bytes.\n\n### **What happens if the TTL field in an IPv4 packet reaches zero?**\n\n> When the [TTL (Time to Live)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-time-to-live-ttl/) field in an IPv4 packet reaches zero, the packet is typically discarded by the router that decremented TTL to zero.\n\n### **How does fragmentation work in IPv4?**\n\n> IPv4 allows packet [fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fragmentation-network-layer/) when a packet is too large to travel a network path without being split down into smaller parts. Routers along the path can split a packet into smaller chunks. The receiver then reassembles these fragments into the original packet using the identity, flags, and fragment offset fields from the header.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-unicast-broadcast-and-multicast-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Difference between Unicast, Broadcast and Multicast in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-unicast-broadcast-and-multicast-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n86\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

These addresses are what allow devices to identify and locate each other on a network.\n\nTo know all about IP Addresses \u2013 refer to [**What is an IP Address?**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/)\n\nCurrently, there are **two primary versions of Internet Protocol in use: IPv4 and IPv6**. Each version has distinct characteristics, capabilities, and was developed to meet the specific needs of the internet\u2019s growth. IPv4 was the first to be widely implemented, laying the groundwork for early network communications.\n\nHowever, as the internet grew and more devices started connecting online, the limitations of IPv4 became clear, leading to the creation of IPv6. This newer version was designed to address the shortcomings of its predecessor and to future-proof the network against an ever-increasing demand for more addresses and improved network efficiency.\n\n_Let\u2019s explore their differences, why both are still in use, and the advantages each offers._\n\nTable of Content\n\n- [What is IPv4?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/#what-is-ipv4)\n- [What is IPv6?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/#what-is-ipv6)\n- [Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/#difference-between-ipv4-and-ipv6)\n- [Benefits of IPv6 over IPv4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/#benefits-of-ipv6-over-ipv4)\n- [Why IPv4 is Still in Use?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/#why-ipv4-is-still-in-use)\n\n## What is IPv4?\n\nIPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4, is the original addressing system of the Internet, introduced in 1983. It uses a 32-bit address scheme, which theoretically allows for over 4 billion unique addresses (2^32). IPv4 addresses are typically displayed in decimal format, divided into four octets separated by dots. For example, 192.168.1.1 is a common IPv4 address you might find in a home network.\n\n### IPv4 Address Format\n\nIPv4 Address Format is a 32-bit Address that comprises binary digits separated by a dot (.).\n\n![IPv4 Address Format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/IP_addressing_1.jpg)\n\nIPv4 Address Format\n\n### Characteristics of IPv4\n\n- **32-bit address length**: Allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.\n- **Dot-decimal notation**: IP addresses are written in a format of four decimal numbers separated by dots, such as 192.168.1.1.\n- **Packet structure**: Includes a header and payload; the header contains information essential for routing and delivery.\n- **Checksum fields**: Uses checksums in the header for error-checking the header integrity.\n- **Fragmentation**: Allows packets to be fragmented at routers along the route if the packet size exceeds the maximum transmission unit (MTU).\n- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: Used for mapping IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol.\n- **Manual and DHCP configuration**: Supports both manual configuration of IP addresses and dynamic configuration through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).\n- **Limited address space**: The main limitation which has led to the development of IPv6 to cater to more devices.\n- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Used to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.\n- **Security**: Lacks inherent security features, requiring additional protocols such as IPSec for secure communications.\n\n### Drawbacks of IPv4\n\n- **Limited Address Space** : IPv4 has a limited number of addresses, which is not enough for the growing number of devices connecting to the internet.\n- **Complex Configuration** : IPv4 often requires manual configuration or DHCP to assign addresses, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n- **Less Efficient Routing** : The IPv4 header is more complex, which can slow down data processing and routing.\n- **Security Issues** : IPv4 does not have built-in security features, making it more vulnerable to attacks unless extra security measures are added.\n- **Limited Support for Quality of Service (QoS)** : IPv4 has limited capabilities for prioritizing certain types of data, which can affect the performance of real-time applications like video streaming and VoIP.\n- **Fragmentation** : IPv4 allows routers to fragment packets, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased chances of data being lost or corrupted.\n- **Broadcasting Overhead** : IPv4 uses broadcasting to communicate with multiple devices on a network, which can create unnecessary network traffic and reduce performance.\n\n![IPv4-vs-ipv6](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241209154735532715/IPv4-vs-ipv6.webp)\n\n## What is IPv6?\n\nAnother most common version of the Internet Protocol currently is IPv6. The well-known IPv6 protocol is being used and deployed more often, especially in mobile phone markets. IPv6 was designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in December 1998 with the purpose of superseding IPv4 due to the global exponentially growing internet of users.\n\nIPv6 stands for Internet Protocol version 6. IPv6 is the new version of Internet Protocol, which is way better than IPv4 in terms of complexity and efficiency.\u00a0IPv6 is written as a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colon (:). It can be written as 128 bits of 0s and 1s.\n\n### IPv6 Address Format\n\nIPv6 Address Format is a 128-bit IP Address, which is written in a group of 8 hexadecimal numbers separated by colon (:).\n\n![IPv6 Address Format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/ipv6-1-2-1024x284.png)\n\nIPv6 Address Format\n\n**To switch from IPv4 to IPv6, there are several strategies:**\n\n- **Dual Stacking** : Devices can use both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time. This way, they can talk to networks and devices using either version.\n- **Tunneling** : This method allows IPv6 users to send data through an IPv4 network to reach other IPv6 users. Think of it as creating a \u201ctunnel\u201d for IPv6 traffic through the older IPv4 system.\n- **Network Address Translation (NAT)** : NAT helps devices using different versions of IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) to communicate with each other by translating the addresses so they understand each other.\n\n### Characteristics of IPv6\n\n- IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, offering a much larger address space than IPv4\u2019s 32-bit system.\n- IPv6 addresses use a combination of numbers and letters separated by colons, allowing for more unique addresses.\n- The IPv6 header has fewer fields, making it more efficient for routers to process.\n- IPv6 supports Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast, but no Broadcast, reducing network traffic.\n- IPv6 allows flexible subnetting (VLSM) to divide networks based on specific needs.\n- IPv6 uses Neighbor Discovery for MAC address resolution instead of ARP.\n- IPv6 uses advanced routing protocols like OSPFv3 and RIPng for better address handling.\n- IPv6 devices can self-assign IP addresses using SLAAC, or use DHCPv6 for more control.\n- IPv6 handles fragmentation at the sender side, not by routers, improving speed.\n\n## **Difference Between IPv4 and IPv6**\n\n| **IPv4** | **IPv6** |\n| --- | --- |\n| IPv4 has a 32-bit address length | IPv6 has a 128-bit address length |\n| It Supports Manual and [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) address configuration | It supports Auto and renumbering address configuration |\n| In IPv4 end to end, connection integrity is Unachievable | In IPv6 end-to-end, connection integrity is Achievable |\n| It can generate 4.29\u00d710  9  address space | The address space of IPv6 is quite large it can produce 3.4\u00d710  38  address space |\n| The Security feature is dependent on the application | IPSEC is an inbuilt security feature in the IPv6 protocol |\n| Address representation of IPv4 is in decimal | Address representation of IPv6 is in hexadecimal |\n| [Fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/) performed by Sender and forwarding routers | In IPv6 fragmentation is performed only by the sender |\n| In IPv4 Packet flow identification is not available | In IPv6 packet flow identification are Available and uses the flow label field in the header |\n| In IPv4 checksum field is available | In IPv6 [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-checksum-and-crc/) field is not available |\n| It has a broadcast Message Transmission Scheme | In IPv6 multicast and anycast message transmission scheme is available |\n| In IPv4 Encryption and Authentication facility not provided | In IPv6 [Encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-encryption/) and Authentication are provided |\n| IPv4 has a header of 20-60 bytes. | IPv6 has a header of 40 bytes fixed |\n| IPv4 can be converted to IPv6 | Not all IPv6 can be converted to IPv4 |\n| IPv4 consists of 4 fields which are separated by addresses dot (.) | IPv6 consists of 8 fields, which are separated by a colon (:) |\n| IPv4\u2019s \u00a0IP addresses are divided into five different classes. Class A , Class B, Class C, Class D , Class E. | IPv6 does not have any classes of the IP address. |\n| IPv4 supports VLSM( [Variable Length subnet mask](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/) ). | IPv6 does not support VLSM. |\n| Example of IPv4: \u00a066.94.29.13 | Example of IPv6: 2001:0000:3238:DFE1:0063:0000:0000:FEFB |\n\n## Benefits of IPv6 over IPv4\n\nThe recent Version of IP IPv6 has a greater advantage over IPv4. Here are some of the mentioned benefits:\n\n- **Larger Address Space:** IPv6 has a greater address space than IPv4, which is required for expanding the IP Connected Devices. IPv6 has 128 bit IP Address rather and IPv4 has a 32-bit Address.\n- **Improved Security:** IPv6 has some improved security which is built in with it. IPv6 offers security like Data Authentication, Data Encryption, etc. Here, an Internet Connection is more Secure.\n- **Simplified Header Format:** As compared to IPv4, IPv6 has a simpler and more effective header Structure, which is more cost-effective and also increases the speed of Internet Connection.\n- **Prioritize:** IPv6 contains stronger and more reliable support for QoS features, which helps in increasing traffic over websites and increases audio and video quality on pages.\n- **Improved Support for Mobile Devices:** IPv6 has increased and better support for Mobile Devices. It helps in making quick connections over other Mobile Devices and in a safer way than IPv4.\n\n## Why IPv4 is Still in Use?\n\n1. **Infrastructure Compatibility** Many systems and devices are built for IPv4 and require significant updates to support IPv6, including routers, switches, and computers.\n2. **Cost of Transition** \u2013 Switching to IPv6 can be expensive and complex, involving hardware updates, software upgrades, and training for personnel.\n3. **Lack of Immediate Need** \u2013 Techniques like NAT (Network Address Translation) help extend the life of IPv4 by allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address, reducing the urgency to switch to IPv6.\n4. **Coexistence Strategies** \u2013 Technologies that allow IPv4 and IPv6 to run simultaneously make it easier for organizations to adopt IPv6 gradually while maintaining their existing IPv4 systems.\n5. **Slow Global Adoption** \u2013 The adoption of IPv6 varies significantly around the world, which necessitates the continued support of IPv4 for global connectivity.\n6. **Lack of Visible Benefits** \u2013 Many users and organizations don\u2019t see immediate improvements with IPv6 if they don\u2019t face an IP address shortage, reducing the incentive to upgrade.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe shift from IPv4 to IPv6 is more than just an expansion of address space; it represents a necessary evolution in internet architecture to accommodate future growth and innovation. Understanding these differences helps not only in appreciating how the internet works but also in foreseeing how technology will continue to evolve to meet the needs of an increasingly connected world.\n\n## Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Which is Better IPv4 or IPv6?**\n\n> IPv6 is better than IPv4 as IPv6 is more advanced and has more features than IPv4.\n\n### **Can we use both IPv4 and IPv6**\n\n> Yes, We can use both IPv4 and IPV6 in a single machine. There are devices that support dual addressing. When two devices communicate, they agree on which IP Version to use.\n\n### **Which is faster IPv4 or IPv6?**\n\n> Generally, IPv6 is faster than IPv4. However, when we go to a larger packet size, IPv6 can be slow in some cases.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-unicast-address-in-ccna/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Global Unicast Address in CCNA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/global-unicast-address-in-ccna/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Samdare%20B/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Samdare B](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Samdare%20B/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Difference Between](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/difference-between/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

IP Address is unique for each computer.\n\n## Classification of IP Address\n\nAn IP Address is basically classified into two types:\n\n- Private IP Address\n- Public IP Address\n\n## What is a Private IP Address?\n\nThe [Private IP Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/private-ip-addresses-in-networking/) of a system is the IP address that is used to communicate within the same network. Using private IP data or information can be sent or received within the same network.\u00a0The router basically assigns these types of addresses to the device. Unique private IP Addresses are provided to each and every device that is present on the network. These things make Private IP Addresses more secure than Public IP Addresses.\n\n### Can we trace Private IP Address?\n\nYes, we can trace Private IP Addresses, but this happens only by using other devices on the local network. Devices that are connected to the local network has private IP Address and this can only be visible to the devices that are connected within that network. But it can\u2019t be seen online as it happens in public IP Addresses.\n\n## What is a Public IP Address?\n\nThe Public IP Address of a system is the IP address that is used to communicate outside the network. A public IP address is basically assigned by the [ISP (Internet Service Provider)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isp-full-form/).\n\n**Public IP Address** is basically of two types:\n\n- [Dynamic IP Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-ip-address/): Dynamic IP Addresses are addresses that change over time. After establishing a connection of a smartphone or computer with the Internet, ISP provides an IP Address to the device, these random addresses are called Dynamic IP Address.\n- [Static IP Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-ip-address/): Static Addresses are those addresses that do not change with time. These are stated as permanent internet addresses. Mostly these are used by the [DNS (Domain Name System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) Servers.\n\n### Can we trace Public IP Address?\n\nYes, Public IP Addresses can be traced back to the Internet Service Provider that can easily trace the geographical location. This might reveal the location very easily to advertisers, hackers, etc. For using the Internet anonymously, you can easily hide your IP Address by using different ways like VPN, Tor Browser, etc. But among different ways, VPN is the fastest and most secure way of using the Internet.\n\n![Difference Between Private and Public IP Addresses](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230808125810/Private-and-Public-IP-Address-768.png)\n\nDifference Between Private and Public IP Addresses\n\n## Difference Between Private and Public IP Addresses\n\n| Private IP Address | Public IP Address |\n| --- | --- |\n| The scope of Private IP is local. | The scope of Public IP is global. |\n| It is used to communicate within the network. | It is used to communicate outside the network. |\n| Private IP addresses of the systems connected in a network differ in a uniform manner. | Public IP may differ in a uniform or non-uniform manner. |\n| It works only on LAN. | It is used to get internet service. |\n| It is used to load the network operating system. | It is controlled by ISP. |\n| It is available free of cost. | It is not free of cost. |\n| Private IP can be known by entering \u201cipconfig\u201d on the command prompt. | Public IP can be known by searching \u201cwhat is my ip\u201d on Google. |\n| **Range:**<br>> **10.0.0.0 \u2013 10.255.255.255,**<br>> <br>> **172.16.0.0 \u2013 172.31.255.255,**<br>> <br>> **192.168.0.0 \u2013 192.168.255.255** | **Range:** Besides private IP addresses, the rest are public. |\n| Example: 192.168.1.10 | Example: 17.5.7.8 |\n| Private IP uses numeric code that is not unique and can be used again | Public IP uses a numeric code that is unique and cannot be used by other |\n| Private IP addresses are secure | The public IP address has no security and is \u00a0subjected to attack |\n| Private IP addresses require NAT to communicate with devices | Public IP does not require a network translation |\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### 1\\. Whether a device can have both Public and Private IP Addresses at a time?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Yes, a device can have both Public and Private IP Addresses at a single time. This usually happens when Network Address Translation connects the local network to the Internet.\n\n### 2\\. Can we access the Internet with our Private IP Address?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Yes, we can access the Internet with our Private IP Address. Router having both private and public IP Addresses connection, becomes an intermediate in connecting or accessing Internet.\n\n### 3\\. Differentiate between Private vs Local vs Internal IP Addresses.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> As like public IP Address and external IP Address can be interchanged, similarly in that way private and internal IP Address can be interchanged and a private IP Address is also called as Local IP Address.\n\n### 4\\. How does a Public IP Address differ from an external IP Address?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Public IP Address and External IP Address are similar terms. This helps you in connecting to the Internet from inside to outside your network.\n\n### 5\\. What is the range of Private IP Addresses?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> The range of Private IP Addresses is defined by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and it never appears on the Internet.

It is one of the most important layers which plays a key role in data transmission. The main job of this layer is to maintain the quality of the data and pass and transmit it from its source to its destination. It also handles [routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-routing/), which means that it chooses the best path to transmit the data from the source to its destination, not just transmitting the packet. There are several important protocols that work in this layer.\n\n![29](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127103223827920/29.webp)\n\nNetwork Layer in OSI Model\n\nData is transmitted in the form of packets via various logical network pathways between various devices. It offers routes for data packet transfers across the network. The network layer is also responsible for organizing and controlling the available paths for data transfer.\n\n## Functions of Network Layer\n\nSome of the most important functions of the network layer are given below :\n\n1. **Assigning Logical Address**: It provides unique IP addresses to devices for identification and communication across networks.\n2. **Packetizing**: It encapsulates data into packets for efficient transmission.\n3. **Host-to-Host Delivery**: It ensures data is delivered from the sender to the intended receiver across networks.\n4. **Forwarding**: It is the process of moving packets from the input to the appropriate output interface in a router, based on the destination address\n5. **Fragmentation and Reassembly**: It splits large packets into smaller fragments for transmission and reassembles them at the destination.\n6. **Logical Subnetting**: It divides larger networks into smaller subnetworks for better management and routing efficiency.\n7. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Maps private IP addresses to a public IP for internet access, conserving IPs and adding security.\n8. **Routing**: It determines the best path for packets to travel to their destination across multiple networks.\n\n![0.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127103713496226/0.webp)![0.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127103713496226/0.webp)\n\n![1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817447789/1.webp)![1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817447789/1.webp)\n\n![2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817602068/2.webp)![2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817602068/2.webp)\n\n![3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817750495/3.webp)![3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817750495/3.webp)\n\n![4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817901084/4.webp)![4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172817901084/4.webp)\n\n![5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818073690/5.webp)![5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818073690/5.webp)\n\n![6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818238834/6.webp)![6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818238834/6.webp)\n\n![7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818379608/7.webp)![7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818379608/7.webp)\n\n![8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818556229/8.webp)![8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124172818556229/8.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 9\n\nRead more about [Functions of Network Layer.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-services-packetizing-routing-and-forwarding/)\n\n## How Does the Network Layer Work?\n\n- Every device gets a unique address (IP address) to identify it on the network.\n- Data is packaged into small packets, with labels showing where it\u2019s coming from and where it\u2019s going.\n- Routers figure out the best path to send the packets to their destination.\n- Packets travel step by step through different routers until they reach the right device.\n- If a packet is too big, it gets broken into smaller pieces to fit through the network.\n- At the destination, the pieces are put back together into the original data.\n- If something goes wrong, like the destination can\u2019t be reached, an error message is sent back.\n\n## Protocols Used at Network Layer\n\nThe **protocols used at the Network Layer** are:\n\n1. **IP (** [**Internet Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-internet-protocol-ip/) **)**\n2. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**\n3. **ARP (** [**Address Resolution Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arp-protocol/) **)**\n4. **RARP (** [**Reverse Address Resolution Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-rarp/) **)**\n5. **NAT (** [**Network Address Translation**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/) **)**\n6. **Routing Protocols**:\n   - **RIP (** [**Routing Information Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/) **)**\n   - **OSPF (** [**Open Shortest Path First**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-states/) **)**\n   - **BGP (** [**Border Gateway Protocol**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/) **)**\n7. **IPSec (** [**Internet Protocol Security**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-security-ipsec/) **)**\n8. **MPLS (** [**Multiprotocol Label Switching**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multi-protocol-label-switching-mpls/) **)**\n\n## Advantages of Network Layer\n\n- Using the network layer in the OSI paradigm offers a multitude of advantages. Let\u2019s delve into some of these benefits:\n- The network layer takes the data and breaks it down into packets, which makes transmitting the data over the network easier. This process also eliminates any weak points in the transmission, ensuring that the packet successfully reaches its intended destination.\n- Router is the important component of the network layer . Its role is to reduce network congestion by facilitating collisions and broadcasting the domains within the network layer.\n- Used to send data packets across the network nodes, the forwarding method is various.\n\n## Limitations of Network Layer\n\n- There is no flow control mechanism provided by the network layer design.\n- There may be times when there are too many datagrams in transit over the network, causing congestion. This could put further strain on the network routers. In some circumstances, the router may lose some data packets if there are too many datagrams. Important data may be lost in the process of transmission as a result of this.\n- Indirect control cannot be implemented at the network layer since the data packets are broken up before being sent. Additionally, this layer lacks effective error control systems.\n\n## Difference Between Routing and Flooding\n\n| Routing | Flooding |\n| --- | --- |\n| A routing table is required. | No Routing table is required |\n| May give the shortest path. | Always gives the shortest path. |\n| Routing is less reliable | Flooding is more reliable |\n| Traffic is less in Routing | Traffic is more in Flooding |\n| Duplicate packets are not present | Duplicate packet are present |\n\n**For practice, solve** [**quiz on Network Layer**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quizzes/network-layer-gq/?ref=quiz_lbp) **.**\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Network Layer \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Which is network layer device?**\n\n> [Routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) is network layer device. A router is a device that routes data packets based on IP addresses.\n\n### What services are offered by Network Layer in general?\n\n> [Packetizing, Forwarding and Routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-services-packetizing-routing-and-forwarding/) are the three general services offered by Network Layer.\n\n### Which algorithms are used by network layer when there is a congestion in the network?\n\n> Network layer uses algorithms like Token Bucket Algorithm and [Leaky Bucket Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/) to handle congestion.\n\n### **How does the Network Layer handle fragmentation and reassembly?**\n\n> The reassembly is done by the destination, or receiving host. For your reference: The receiving host reassembles the fragments. Furthermore, according to further sources: An IP datagram is fragmented and isn\u2019t put back together until it reaches its destination.\n\n### **What is a subnet?**\n\n> A network inside another network is called a subnet, or subnetwork. Subnets improve the efficiency of networks. Network communication can travel a shorter distance and avoid going through extra routers by using subnetting to reach its destination.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/NetworkLayerVideo/NetworkLayer20241128170952-small.png)\n\n## Network Layer in Computer Network\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/CircuitSwitchingVsPacketSwitchingVideo/CircuitSwitchingVsPacketSwitching20241128171355-small.png)\n\n## Circuit Switching Vs Packet Switching - CN\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/ClassfulAddressingVideo/ClassfulAddressing20241128171918-small.png)\n\n## Classful IP Addressing in Computer Network\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/NetworkAddressTranslationVideo/NetworkAddressTranslationNAT20241230181720-small.png)\n\n## Network Address Translation (NAT)\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/SubnettingVideo/Subnetting20241128172240-small.png)\n\n## Introduction to Subnetting\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/ClasslessInterDomainRoutingCIDRCN/CIDR20241128172640-small.png)\n\n## Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) - CN\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/MoreonSubnettingandCIDRVideo/MoreonSubnettingandCIDRinCN20241230182206-small.png)\n\n## More on Subnetting and CIDR in CN\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/MoreonSubnettingVideo/MoreonSubnettinginCN20241230182445-small.png)\n\n## More on Subnetting in CN\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/AddressResolutionProtocolVideo/AddressResolutionProtocol20241128173919-small.png)\n\n## Address Resolution Protocol in Computer Networ...\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/BackgroundofRoutingAlgorithmsVideo/RoutingAlgorithmsinComputerNetwork20241230182923-small.png)\n\n## Routing Algorithms in Computer Network\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/DistanceVectorRoutingVideo/DistanceVectorRoutingDVRProtocol20241230183158-small.png)\n\n## Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol\n\n![Video Thumbnail](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/LinkStateRoutingVideo/LinkStateRoutinginComputerNetworks20241230183513-small.png)\n\n## Link State Routing in Computer Networks\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Session Layer in OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sl8mi8kvkvt5z3lx7ho6)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/dwaipayan_bandyopadhyay/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[dwaipayan\\_bandyopadhyay](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/dwaipayan_bandyopadhyay/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n2\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Network Layer in OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Network Layer is the 5th Layer from the top and the 3rd layer from the Bottom of the OSI Model.

This also boosts security and makes it easier to manage the network, as each subnet can be monitored and controlled separately.\u00a0In this article, we will discuss Subnetting in detail.\n\n## Introduction to Subnet\n\nA subnet is like a smaller group within a large network. It is a way to split a large network into smaller networks so that devices present in one network can transmit data more easily. For example, in a company, different departments can each have their own subnet, keeping their data traffic separate from others. Subnet makes the network faster and easier to manage and also improves the security of the network.\n\n## Why Subnetting is Important?\n\nLet\u2019s consider a company that follows [classful addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/), it has a **Class C network (192.168.1.0/24)** with **256** [**IP addresses**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/). It has three departments:\n\n- **Sales**: 20 devices\n- **HR**: 10 devices\n- **IT**: 50 devices\n\nWithout subnetting, all departments share the same network, and all **256 IP addresses** are available to everyone, which leads to:\n\n- **IP Waste**: Only **80 devices** are needed (20 + 10 + 50), but all 256 addresses are allocated, wasting **176 addresses**.\n\n- **Performance Issues**: Since all departments are on the same network, any data sent between devices floods the entire network, slowing communication for everyone. For example, heavy data transfer in IT can impact Sales and HR.\n\n- **Security Risks**: Without subnets, anyone in Sales can access HR or IT devices, exposing sensitive data like payroll systems.\n\n**With Subnetting**, we split the network into three subnets, allocating just enough IP addresses for each department:\n\n- **Sales**: 192.168.1.0/27 \u2192 32 IPs (for 20 devices, 12 spare)\n- **HR**: 192.168.1.32/28 \u2192 16 IPs (for 10 devices, 6 spare)\n- **IT**: 192.168.1.48/26 \u2192 64 IPs (for 50 devices, 14 spare)\n\n**By subnetting, we:**\n\n- **Save IP addresses (Efficiency)**: Only 112 addresses are used (80 + some spare), leaving 144 unused for future growth.\n\n- **Keep networks faster** **(Better Performance)**: Data within each department stays in its subnet. For example, HR traffic stays in HR, reducing network congestion for Sales and IT.\n\n- **Protect sensitive data (Improved Security)**: Each department is isolated. If someone in Sales tries to access HR systems, subnet restrictions block them.\n\n## Key Concepts in Subnetting\n\n### IP Addressing\n\nAn [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) is made up of different parts, each serving a specific purpose in identifying a device on a network. An IPv4 address consists of four parts called \u201coctets,\u201d separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It has two main sections:\n\n- **Network Portion**: Identifies the network the device belongs to.\n- **Host Portion**: Uniquely identifies a device within the network.\n\nIPv4 addresses are divided into classes based on the length of the network and host portions:\n\n- **Class A**: 8-bit network ID, 24-bit host ID.\n- **Class B**: 16-bit network ID, 16-bit host ID.\n- **Class C**: 24-bit network ID, 8-bit host ID.\n\n![hostandnetid-660x413](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250107215830240237/hostandnetid-660x413.png)\n\nFor more details, refer to [Classful IP Addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/).\n\n### What is a Subnet Mask?\n\nA [**subnet mask**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/role-of-subnet-mask/) is a 32-bit number used in IP addressing to separate the network portion of an [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) from the host portion. It helps computers and devices determine which part of an IP address refers to the network they are present, and which part refers to their specific location or address within that network.\n\n### **CIDR Notation: A Simplified Approach to Subnetting**\n\nInstead of using a long subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0), CIDR uses a simple format like **/24**. The number after the slash ( **/n**) represents the number of bits used for the **network portion** of the IP address.\n\n## How Subnetting Works?\n\nThe working of subnets starts in such a way that firstly it divides the subnets into smaller subnets. For communicating between subnets, routers are used. Each subnet allows its linked devices to communicate with each other. Subnetting for a network should be done in such a way that it does not affect the network bits.\n\nIn class C the first 3 octets are network bits so it remains as it is.\n\n- **For Subnet-1:** The first bit which is chosen from the host id part is zero and the range will be from (193.1.2.00000000 till you get all 1\u2019s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.01111111) except for the first bit which is chosen zero for subnet id part.\n\nThus, the range of subnet 1 is: **193.1.2.0 to 193.1.2.127**\n\n```\nSubnet id of Subnet-1 is : 193.1.2.0\nThe direct Broadcast id of Subnet-1 is: 193.1.2.127\nThe total number of hosts possible is: 126 (Out of 128, 2 id's are used for Subnet id & Direct Broadcast id)\nThe subnet mask of Subnet- 1 is: 255.255.255.128\n```\n\n- **For Subnet-2:** The first bit chosen from the host id part is one and the range will be from (193.1.2.100000000 till you get all 1\u2019s in the host ID part i.e, 193.1.2.11111111).\n\nThus, the range of subnet-2 is: **193.1.2.128 to 193.1.2.255**\n\n```\nSubnet id of Subnet-2 is : 193.1.2.128\nThe direct Broadcast id of Subnet-2 is: 193.1.2.255\nThe total number of hosts possible is: 126 (Out of 128, 2 id's are used for Subnet id &  Direct Broadcast id)\nThe subnet mask of Subnet- 2 is: 255.255.255.128\nThe best way to find out the subnet mask of a subnet is to set the fixed bit of host-id to 1 and the rest to 0.\n```\n\nFinally, after using the subnetting the total number of usable hosts is reduced from 254 to 252.\n\n**Note:**\n\n1. To divide a network into four (2 2 ) parts you need to choose two bits from the host id part for each subnet i.e, (00, 01, 10, 11).\n2. To divide a network into eight (2 3 ) parts you need to choose three bits from the host id part for each subnet i.e, (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) and so on.\n3. We can say that if the total number of subnets in a network increases the total number of usable hosts decreases.\n\n**The network can be divided into two parts:** To divide a network into two parts, you need to choose one bit for each Subnet from the host ID part.\n\n![Subnetting](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/subnetting.111111.jpg)\n\nIn the above diagram, there are two Subnets.\n\n**Note:** It is a class C IP so, there are 24 bits in the network id part and 8 bits in the host id part.\n\n### **Example 1:** An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192 to divide this into sub-networks. Which of the following is/are valid host IP addresses?\n\n1. 201.35.2.129\n2. 201.35.2.191\n3. 201.35.2.255\n4. Both (A) and (C)\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```\nConverting the last octet of the netmask into the binary form: 255.255.255.11000000\nConverting the last octet of option 1 into the binary form: 201.35.2.10000001\nConverting the last octet of option 2 into the binary form: 201.35.2.10111111\nConverting the last octet of option 3 into the binary form: 201.35.2.11111111\n```\n\nFrom the above, we see that Options 2 and 3 are not valid host IP addresses (as they are broadcast addresses of a subnetwork), and **OPTION 1** is not a broadcast address and it can be assigned to a host IP.\n\n### **Example 2:** An organization has a class C network address of 201.32.64.0. It uses a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248. Which of the following is NOT a valid broadcast address for any subnetworks?\n\n1. 201.32.64.135\n2. 201.32.64.240\n3. 201.32.64.207\n4. 201.32.64.231\n\n**Solution:**\n\n```\nConverting the last octet of the netmask into the binary form: 255.255.255.11111000\nConverting the last octet of option 1 into the binary form: 201.32.64.10000111\nConverting the last octet of option 2 into the binary form: 201.32.64.11110000\nConverting the last octet of option 3 into the binary form: 201.32.64.11001111\nConverting the last octet of option 4 into the binary form: 201.32.64.11100111\n```\n\nFrom the above, we can see that in OPTION 1, 3, and 4, all the host bits are 1 and give the valid broadcast address of subnetworks.\n\nand **OPTION 2,** the last three bits of the Host address are not 1 therefore it\u2019s not a valid broadcast address.\n\n## Advantages of Subnetting\n\n- It provides security to one network from another network. For example: In an Organization, the code of the Developer department must not be accessed by another department.\n\n- It may be possible that a particular subnet might need higher network priority than others. For example, a Sales department needs to host webcasts or video conferences.\n\n- In the case of Small networks, maintenance is easy.\n\n## Disadvantages of Subnetting\n\n- In the case of a single network, only three steps are required to reach a Process i.e Source Host to Destination Network, Destination Network to Destination Host, and then Destination Host to Process.\n\n- In the case of a Single Network only two IP addresses are wasted to represent Network Id and Broadcast address but in the case of Subnetting two IP addresses are wasted for each Subnet.\n\n- The cost of the overall Network also increases. Subnetting requires internal [routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/), [Switches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-switches-in-computer-network/), [Hubs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-hub-and-how-it-works/), Bridges, etc. which are very costly.\n\n**To learn all the basic to advanced subnetting concepts, refer to** [**Subnet Mask Cheat Sheet**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/subnet-cheat-sheet/) **.**\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Subnetting \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What is IP Addressing?\n\n> IP addressing is a method used to identify and locate devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other over the internet.\n\n### What is Point to Point Subnet?\n\n> A point-to-point subnet is a network configuration that connects two devices directly to each other, typically using a dedicated link. This type of subnet is often used for communication between routers or other network devices without any other devices on the same link.\n\n### What is IPv6 Subnetting?\n\n> IPv6 subnetting is the process of dividing an IPv6 address space into smaller, manageable subnets. It allows organizations to efficiently allocate and manage their IP addresses within the larger IPv6 framework.\n\n### **What is the difference between a public and private subnet?**\n\n> A public subnet allows devices to communicate directly with the internet, while a private subnet is isolated from the internet and typically used for internal communication within an organization.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classless-inter-domain-routing-cidr/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/zhc116j7idv67y0ru7oz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/nidhi1352singh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[nidhi1352singh](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/nidhi1352singh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

It tells devices which portion of the address belongs to the network and which identifies individual devices. By doing this it helps to determine which devices belong to the same local network and which devices reside on different networks. It supports efficient network organization, better control of data flow and overall improved security and management of the network.\n\nFor example:\n\n![Role-of-Subnet-Mask](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250108114800758375/Role-of-Subnet-Mask.webp)\n\nRole of Subnet Mask\n\nSubnet masks help divide a large network into smaller sub-networks (subnets), improving network efficiency, security, and performance.\n\n## Function of Subnet Mask\n\n### Why Use a Subnet Mask?\n\nSuppose we have a Class A network which means we have 16 million hosts in a network. Managing such a large network becomes challenging due to:\n\n1. Maintenance of such a huge network.\n2. Security for the network \u2013 For example, we have 4 departments in a company, and all of the 4 departments need access to the whole network.\n\n#### **Solution: Subnetting**\n\nSubnetting solves these problems by dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets). Each department gets its own subnet, improving security and efficiency.\n\nWithout subnetting, identifying a device requires three steps:\n\n- Identification of the network\n- Identification of the host\n- Identification of the process\n\nIn case of addressing with subnetting, the process of reaching an address is done by 4 steps \u2013\n\n1. Identification of the network\n2. Identification of the subnet\n3. Identification of the host\n4. Identification of the process\n\nSuppose we have a Class C network and we want to divide it into 4 subnets. To divide we need to choose 2 bits from the host part.\n\n![Subnetting](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200313202911/Picture130.png)\n\nAs the first and last IP addresses are reserved for **network ID** and **directed broadcast address** in every subnet, we have to reserve 8 IP addresses in this case.\n\n![Subnet Mask](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200313203230/2020-03-131.png)\n\n## Representation of Subnet Masks\n\nA subnet mask is a 32-bit number made of 1s and 0s. The 1s identify the network, and the 0s represent devices (hosts) in that network. For this case subnet mask is,\n\n> 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000\n>\n> or\n>\n> 255.255.255.192\n\nSo in order to get the network which the destination address belongs to we have to **bitwise &** with subnet mask.\n\n> 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000\n>\n> && 11001000.00000001.00000010.00010100\n>\n> \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n>\n> 11001000.00000001.00000010.00000000\n\nThe address belongs to,\n\n> 11001000.00000001.00000010.00000000\n>\n> or\n>\n> 200.1.2.0\n\nThe internal router will forward the packet to the network through an interface . The interface will be identified by the routing table residing in the router.\n\n## **Routing Table and Subnet Matching**\n\nIf the network id doesn\u2019t matches with any of the subnet mask then the packet will be sent to **default entry.**\n\nDefault entry has network id as 0.0.0.0.\n\n![Routing Table](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200313203838/2020-03-13-1.png)\n\nIn some cases the network id may match with two entries in the [routing table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/), so here the interface having the longest subnet mask **(more 1\u2019s)** is selected.\n\n## **How Does Subnetting Work**\n\n[**Subnetting**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-subnetting/) divides a large network into smaller sub-networks by modifying the subnet mask. This improves the management of IP addresses, reduces broadcast traffic, and increases network security by isolating different parts of the network. Subnetting also helps optimize the use of IP address space and improves troubleshooting and overall network performance.\n\nFor example, subnetting can organize devices into logical groups, such as separating a company\u2019s departments into different subnets. This way, traffic within one department does not unnecessarily interfere with others, improving performance and security\n\n## Network Classes\n\nThe **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**, through InterNIC, oversees the allocation of IP addresses. IP addresses are divided into classes to simplify their use, with **Classes A, B, and C** being the most commonly used. Classes D and E exist but are not used by end users. Each class has a **default subnet mask**, and the first octet of the IP address determines its class. The ranges of Class A, B, and C Internet addresses are given below, along with a sample address for each:\n\n![Ranges of Classes](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241216165032658788/table.webp)\n\nRange of Classes\n\nRead more about [classful IP addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/).\n\n## Advantages of Subnetting\n\n- **Reduces network congestion**: Limits broadcast traffic, improving network speed.\n\n- **Efficient IP Usage**: Allocates IPs based on need, avoiding wastage.\n\n- **Enhances security by isolating subnets**: For example, no other department within an organization should be able to view the code created by the Developer department.\n\n- **Enables Departmental Segmentation**: A higher network priority may be needed for some subnets than for others. For instance, a sales department might need to hold video conferences or webcasts.\n\n- **Supports Scalability**: Allows networks to grow while remaining organized.\n\n## Disadvantages of Subnetting\n\n- **Limited IP Address Space**: Dividing networks reduces available IPs per subnet.\n\n- **Additional Hardware**: Subnetting reduces the overall number of [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structure-and-types-of-ip-address/) in the network, yet it could necessitate purchasing extra hardware, like a [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/). Thus it could be very expensive.\n\n- **Complex Setup**: Requires expertise to plan and configure subnets.\n\n- **Compatibility Issues**: Older devices or systems may struggle with subnetting configurations.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Subnet Mask \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### **How is a subnet mask represented?**\n\n> A subnet mask is a 32-bit value, often written in dotted decimal notation, like `255.255.255.0`. The 1s in the mask represent the network and subnet portion, while the 0s represent the host portion.\n\n### **How does subnetting help in network design?**\n\n> Subnetting splits large networks into smaller ones, reducing broadcast traffic and improving speed and security.\n\n### **Can subnet masks have variable lengths?**\n\n> Yes, subnet masks can have variable lengths, which is known as **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)**. This allows more flexible allocation of IP address ranges.\n\n### **Why is subnetting important for security?**\n\n> Subnetting can isolate network segments, which helps prevent unauthorized access and limits the spread of network vulnerabilities or infections\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction of Classful IP Addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

Calculating the number of hosts that can fit into each subnet is essential for efficient IP address usage and network optimization. This calculation not only ensures efficient use of IP addresses but also enhances network performance and security.\n\nIn this article, you will get to know about the methods and formulas needed to determine host capacity within a subnet, the importance of network and broadcast addresses, and practical examples.\n\n## Subnetting and IP Addresses\n\nSubnetting and IP addressing are fundamental aspects of network design, crucial for efficient network management and optimization.\n\n- An IP address is a unique string of numbers separated by periods (IPv4) or colons (IPv6) that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other on a network.\n\n- An IP address, generally in [IPv4 or IPv6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/) format, serves as a unique identifier for devices on a network, with IPv4 consisting of 32 bits divided into four octets and IPv6 offering a more expansive 128-bit format.\n\n- Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller segments known as **subnets**.It enhances network management by optimizing IP address usage and improving network performance and security.\n\n- **Subnet Mask is** utilized to differentiate between the network and host portions of an IP address. It determines how the IP address is divided between network and host, affecting how network traffic is routed.\n\n- **Subnetting** reduces broadcast domains, limiting the spread of broadcast traffic within a network which improves network performance.\n- Allows for better control over network traffic flow, enhancing security by isolating broadcast traffic within specific subnets.\n- Improves overall network efficiency through targeted and efficient use of IP addresses.\n\n> **Practical Application:**\n>\n> - **Adjusting the Subnet Mask:** For example, changing from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.255.192 allows administrators to create smaller, more manageable networks.\n>\n> - **Host Capacity Calculation:** Uses formulas like 2(32-n)\u22122 to calculate the number of usable hosts per subnet, where n represents the number of bits designated for the network and subnet parts.\n\n![calculating_number_of_host_in_a_subnet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250114150409143549/calculating_number_of_host_in_a_subnet.webp)\n\nCalculating Subnets and Hosts\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Subnet Mask:** This is the mask used to determine what portion of an IP address refers to the network and what part refers to the host.\n- **Subnet Notation:** This is the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation that also indicates the subnet mask.\n- **Total Subnets:** The number of distinct networks that can be created with the given subnet mask.\n- **Usable Hosts per Subnet:** The number of devices that can be assigned IP addresses within each subnet, excluding the network and broadcast addresses.\n\nWe use fundamental networking formulas that are based on the number of bits allocated for network and host parts in the subnet mask. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the calculations:\n\n### Basic Formulas:\n\n1. **Number of Usable Hosts**: Usable\u00a0Hosts = 2h \u2013 2, Where h is the number of bits used for hosts in the subnet mask. The subtraction of 2 accounts for the network address and the broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts.\n2. **Number of Subnets**: Total\u00a0Subnets = 2s Where s is the number of bits borrowed from the original host part to create more network bits in subnetting.\n\n### Example Calculation for a /25 Subnet Mask:\n\n- **Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.128 or /25\n- **CIDR Notation:** /25 indicates that 25 bits are used for the network part.\n\n**Calculating Usable Hosts:**\n\n- Total bits for IPv4 = 32\n- Network bits = 25\n- Host bits h = 32 \u2013 25 = 7\n- Usable Hosts = 27\u22122 = 126\n\n**Calculating Total Subnets:** Assuming we are subnetting within a larger block (e.g., a /24 block):\n\n- Bits borrowed for subnetting s = 25 \u2013 24 (original block) = 1\n- Total Subnets = 21 = 2\n\n### Applying the Formulas to Different Masks:\n\nThe same process applies to other subnet masks, adjusting the number of host bits (h) and the number of borrowed bits (s) accordingly:\n\n- **/26 Subnet Mask:**\n  - Network bits = 26, Host bits h = 6\n  - Usable Hosts = 26\u22122 = 62\n  - Assuming subnetting within a /24, s = 2, Total Subnets = 22 = 4\n- **/27 Subnet Mask:**\n  - Network bits = 27, Host bits h = 5\n  - Usable Hosts = 25\u22122 = 30\n  - Assuming subnetting within a /24, s = 3, Total Subnets = 23 = 8\n\nThese calculations are essential for network engineers and administrators to efficiently plan and allocate IP addresses within a network, ensuring optimal utilization and avoiding address exhaustion.\n\n### Steps to Find the Number of Computers Connected in the Given IP Address\n\n#### 1) Identify the Class of the IP address\n\nTo find the number of computers connected in the network first we need to identify the class of the IP address, there are 5 [classes of IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/) they are A, B, C, D, and E.\n\nEach IPv4 address consists of 32 bits, divided into 4 octets, 1 octet = 8 bits. Look at the first octet to find the class of the given IP address. The range of each class is given in the following table.\n\n![classes_of_ip_address](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250114154017226193/classes_of_ip_address.webp)\n\nclasses of IP Address\n\n**Example:** If the IP address given is 64.19.23.0 then the first octet is 64 which is in the range of 0 to 127, so the given IP address belongs to **class A**.\n\n### **2) Finding the Network IP address**\n\nFinding the network IP address involves determining the portion of an IP address that identifies the specific network to which a device belongs. This can be accomplished by using the subnet mask along with the device\u2019s IP address. Here\u2019s how you can find the network IP address:\n\n- **Understand IP Address and Subnet Mask**: Every device on a network has an IP address and a corresponding subnet mask. The subnet mask helps in identifying how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\n- **Binary Conversion**: Convert both the IP address and the subnet mask into binary. An IP address is composed of four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.15), as is the subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0).\n\n- **Perform a Binary AND Operation**: Perform a bitwise AND operation between the binary form of the IP address and the subnet mask. This operation compares corresponding bits of the IP address and the subnet mask and applies the logical AND operation, which results in the network portion.\n\n> **For example:** If the IP address is 192.168.1.10 (11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010 **in binary**) and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 **in binary**)\n>\n> Then result of the AND operation would be 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000, which corresponds to **192.168.1.0**.\n\n- **Convert Back to Decimal**: Convert the result of the AND operation back to decimal format to get the network address. This is the part of the IP address that identifies the network to which the device is connected.\n\n- **Verification**: You can use various network tools or command-line utilities like **`ipconfig`** (on Windows) or **`ifconfig`** (on Unix/Linux) to display the IP address, subnet mask, and network address for verification.\n\n**3) Finding the number of** hosts **or number of** computers **connected to that network**\n\nThe class it belongs will tell the range of hosts that can connect to that network, it\u2019s given in the below table.\n\n| Classes | Number of networks possible | Number of hosts possible in 1 network | Number of usable hosts in 1 network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A | 126 | 224 | 224 \u2013 2 |\n| B | 16384 | 65536 | 65534 |\n| C | 221 | 256 | 254 |\n| D | no networks | no hosts | \u2013 |\n| E | no networks | no hosts | \u2013 |\n\n> **\\[Note:** _Class D is reserved for_ [_Multicasting_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multicasting-in-computer-network/) _, group email/ broadcast, possible IP address in class D are 2_ __28__\\\n>\\\n> _Class E is reserved for experimental and research / military purposes, possible IP_ addresses _in class E_ is _2_ __28__ **\\]**\n\nIn simple words, the Number of hosts in any network can be calculated with the formula = **2** ****x**** **\u2013 2,** where **x** is the number of host ID bits in the IP address.\n\n**Why do we subtract 2?**\n\nBecausethe first and last addresses are not used for any hosts because the first IP is used to **represent the whole network ID** while the last IP is used as the **broadcast address**.\n\n**Example:** The given IP address is 192.168.254.1 \u00a0it belongs to class C, when we perform **AND operation** on IP address with a default mask of class C, we get the network IP address as 192.168.254.0 this is the IP address used to represent the whole network and the broadcast address will be the last IP address of this network which is 192.168.254.255\n\n### Example 1: Find the Class, network IP address, number of hosts (computers), and broadcast address of 9.1.5.31\n\nAnswer: **Finding the Class to which the given IP address belongs to**\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The first octet has a value of 9 which is in the range of 0 to

192 to 223 so the given IP address belongs to **Class C.**\n\n**Finding the Network IP address**\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The default mask for class C as given in the table

\u00a0 => 11001001.00010100.00011110.00101000\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 255.255.255.0 \u00a0 => 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

VLSM allows network administrators to allocate IP addresses more efficiently and effectively, by using smaller subnet masks for subnets with fewer hosts and larger subnet masks for subnets with more hosts.\n\nIn a traditional subnetting scheme, a fixed subnet mask is applied to all subnets in the network, which can lead to inefficient use of IP addresses. For example, if a network has two subnets, one with 10 hosts and another with 50 hosts, a traditional subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 would be used for both subnets, which means that each subnet would have 254 available IP addresses. This would result in wasted IP addresses for the smaller subnet.\n\nVLSM allows network administrators to create subnets with different subnet masks to more effectively utilize IP addresses. Using the example above, VLSM could be used to assign a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 to the smaller subnet with 10 hosts, which would provide 126 available IP addresses, and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 to the larger subnet with 50 hosts, which would provide 62 available IP addresses.\n\nVLSM is widely used in modern networks to create subnets of different sizes and to optimize the use of IP addresses.\n\nVLSM stands for Variable Length Subnet Mask where the subnet design uses more than one mask in the same network which means more than one mask is used for different subnets of a single class A, B, C or a network. It is used to increase the usability of subnets as they can be of variable size. It is also defined as the process of subnetting of a subnet. **Procedure of implementing VLSM \u2013** In VLSM, subnets use block size based on requirement so subnetting is required multiple times. Suppose there is an administrator that has four departments to manage. These are sales and purchase department with 120 computers, development department with 50 computers, accounts department with 26 computers and management department with 5 computers. If the administrator has IP 192.168.1.0/24, department wise IPs can be allocated by following these steps:\n\n1. For each segment select the block size that is greater than or equal to the actual requirement which is the sum of host addresses, broadcast addresses and network addresses. Make a list of subnets possible: ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/vpic5-2.png)**table \u2013** possible subnets list\n2. Arrange all the segments in descending order based on the block size that is from highest to lowest requirement.\n\n```\nSales and Purchase: 120\nDevelopment: 50\nAccounts: 26\nManagement: 5\n```\n\n1. The highest IP available has to be allocated to highest requirement so the sales and purchase department gets 192.168.1.0/25 which has 126 valid addresses that can easily be available for 120 hosts. The subnet mask used is 255.255.255.128\n2. The next segment requires an IP to handle 50 hosts. The IP subnet with network number 192.168.1.128/26 is the next highest which can be assigned to 62 hosts thus fulfilling the requirement of development department. The subnet mask used is 255.255.255.192\n3. Similarly the next IP subnet 192.168.1.192/27 can fulfill the requirements of the accounts department as it has 30 valid hosts IP which can be assigned to 26 computers. The mask used is 255.255.255.224\n4. The last segment requires 5 valid hosts IP which can be fulfilled by the subnet 192.168.1.224/29 which has the mask as 255.255.255.248 is chosen as per the requirement. The IP with the mask 255.255.255.240 could be chosen but it has 14 valid host IPs and the requirement is less in comparison so the one that is comparable with the requirement is chosen. Thus there is less IP wastage in VLSM as compared to FLSM.\n\n**Advantages of VLSM over FLSM \u2013**\n\n1. In Fixed length subnet mask subnetting (FLSM), all subnets are of equal size and have equal number of hosts but in VLSM the size is variable and it can have variable number of hosts thus making the IP addressing more efficient by allowing a routed system of different mask length to suit requirements.\n2. In FLSM there is a wastage of IP addresses but in VLSM there is a minimum wastage of IP addresses.\n3. FLSM is preferred for private IP addresses while for public IP addresses VLSM is the best option.\n4. **More efficient network utilization:** VLSM allows for more efficient use of IP addresses by assigning smaller subnets to areas that require fewer hosts, and larger subnets to areas that require more hosts. This leads to more efficient network utilization and reduces the overall IP address space required.\n5. **Greater flexibility:** VLSM provides greater flexibility in designing IP addressing schemes. It allows network administrators to create subnets of varying sizes based on the specific requirements of each subnet, which can be particularly useful in complex networks.\n6. **Better scalability:** VLSM allows for better scalability of the network as it can accommodate growth and changes in network topology without requiring a complete re-design of the IP addressing scheme.\n7. **Improved network performance:** VLSM can help improve network performance by reducing network congestion and improving the flow of data between subnets.\n8. **Reduced network management overhead:** VLSM can help reduce network management overhead by simplifying the allocation and management of IP addresses. This can be particularly useful in large networks where IP address management can be a significant challenge.\n\n### disadvantages:\n\n1. **Complexity:** VLSM requires more advanced planning and configuration compared to traditional subnetting, which can increase the complexity of the network design and administration.\n2. **Increased management overhead:** With VLSM, there may be more subnets and IP addresses to manage, which can increase the management overhead and make it more difficult to troubleshoot network issues.\n3. **Potential for fragmentation:** If subnets are created with different subnet masks, it can lead to IP address fragmentation, where IP addresses are allocated inefficiently and may not be contiguous.\n4. **Compatibility issues:** VLSM may not be compatible with older networking equipment or protocols, which can limit its usefulness in certain environments.\n5. **Configuration errors:** Because VLSM requires more advanced planning and configuration, there is an increased risk of configuration errors. These errors can cause network connectivity issues, security vulnerabilities, and other problems.\n6. **Reduced network performance:** While VLSM can improve network performance by reducing congestion, it can also have the opposite effect. If subnets are not configured properly, it can lead to network congestion, which can slow down the flow of data.\n7. **Increased training requirements:** VLSM requires more advanced networking knowledge and skills than traditional subnetting, which can increase the training requirements for network administrators.\n8. **Security vulnerabilities:** VLSM can introduce security vulnerabilities if subnets are not properly secured. For example, if a subnet is not properly isolated, it can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n9. **Higher cost:** VLSM can be more expensive than traditional subnetting because it requires more advanced networking equipment and software. This can make it less accessible for small businesses or organizations with limited budgets.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/private-ip-addresses-in-networking/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Private IP Addresses in Networking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/private-ip-addresses-in-networking/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/aaradhanathapliyal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[aaradhanathapliyal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/aaradhanathapliyal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

Specifically, with the virtue of CIDR (Classless Inter-domain Routing), the IP address space is segmented into variable-size subnets against the obscured of the actual number of hosts within each subnet. Typically, such a strategy causes consumption of IP addresses in an inefficient manner, the more so the more distinct within sub-nets is the number of hosts. VLSM enables you to subnet a subnet, that is to turn it into a subnet that has variable sizes. Subnetting in this case means that you can separate a large network into smaller networks so that their size will meet the number of network devices on each network. Thus, subnetting's ability to provide restrictions allows more efficient use of IP address space in IPv4 networking and helps economize on IP address requirements.\n\n## How Does VLSM Work?\n\nCompared with the traditional subnetting method, here you need to use a subnet mask, which offers enough host addresses for the largest subnet while wasting IP addresses for small subnets. [VLSM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/), on the other hand, offers the possibility of employing different subnet masks for different subnets in the same network, thus you can make good use of IP addresses, which is favorable.\n\nlet\u2019s assume that the network has subnet mask 192.168.1.0/24. The way to assign addresses in traditional subnetting would be to carve this into four subnets where each subnet, containing 62 usable IP addresses, would be made up of (2^6 \u2013 2). Yet, if one subnet is merely 10 in number and the other is 50 only, traditional subnetting 52 addresses are wasted. [VLSM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/), you can assign a /28 subnet mask for the first subnet (offering 14 usable addresses) and a /26 subnet mask for the second subnet (offering 62 usable addresses) in this circumstance, promoting the use of IP addresses.\n\n## Benefits of VLSM\n\nVLSM, or Virtual Length Subnet Mask, provides a great number of advantages for the Internet Protocol network design and IP address space usage, e.g. making the networks more efficient and compact.\n\n### **Optimized Use of IP Address Space**\n\nVLSM is designed for the [ICAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/colleges/icam--institut-catholiques-darts-et-mtiers) for which the size of the subnet matches the actual number of hosts in each subnet. Differing from discrete subnetting where the whole network has a unique subnet mask for indefinite network size, VLSM leads the way to the variable division of network size with different subnet masks. This adaptability weighs the required number of IP addresses that a subnet will have, preventing you from wasting IPs and maximizing the IP addressing space.\n\n### **Flexibility in Network Design**\n\nA primary maxim of VLSM is its ability to flexibly design and maintain networks. With VLSM therefore, you now have the ability to create subnets of specific sizes that you may use in determining each area in the network. Either you will be faced with a small subnet for feeding dozens of hosts or with a large subnet that will no doubt number in the department of several devices, VLSM will permit you to adjust the subnet size. As it is required. This versatility allows you to determine instantly which combination of address and carriage is appropriate since network dimensions can change as well as requirements.\n\n### **Cost Savings**\n\nBy better management of IP addresses using VLSM, [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) depletion in large networks can be avoided, which is a significant benefit particularly when large operations are in question. The VLSM technology provides the means for IP-address allocation optimization and decrease of wastage. That is the way organizations are able to use their IP address resources in the most efficient manner possible. This efficiency contributes to the reduction of the expenses associated with the service provision, acquisition of additional IP address blocks, and easing management routines, which invariably result in not much operational expenses in the long run.\n\n### **Improved Network Performance**\n\nVLSM implementation guarantees outstanding network performance in small businesses or enterprises. By bringing the volume of hosts identified in each subnet down to the smallest possible amount, VLSM allows for much fewer broadcasts in total, which positively affects network performance. The optimization here makes it simpler for network resources to become operational accordingly, which eventually results in faster data transmission and a higher overall performance of the network.\n\n### **Enhanced Scalability**\n\nAs networks appear, expand and adjust to meet their performance needs, it becomes necessary to be able to scale out and remain flexible in the face of dynamic requirements. VLSM is indispensable in that it prevents complicated restructuring or disruptive changes when we desire to expand our networks. VLSM facilitates the subdivision of remaining addresses in the address space already allocated to you and the modification of any existing subnets into those that meet your current requirements. Hence, VLSM becomes an excellent provision for the emerging demands of your network.\n\nVirtual Length Subnet Mask (VLSM) enables network designs to be resolved which are the most appropriate in modern networks taking into account the required IP addresses allocation. Whether it comes to IP sent address space saving, costs reduction or network scalability and performance enhancement, VLSM provides network administrators with what they really require for constructing reliable, flexible, and resilient networks.\n\n## Implementation Steps for VLSM\n\nWhile implementing a Virtual Length Subnet Mask , there is a need to plan and configure correctly, enabling the user to allocate IP addresses as required and makes the network perform optimally. The detailed steps to follow during successful implementation of VLSM include the following:\n\n### **Plan the Network**\n\n- **Determine IP Address Range:** Specifically, this entails identifying the whole block of IP addresses that your network will use. The range of the IP addresses, in quartiles, must be enough to host all the hosts and subnets (sixty-four in total).\n- **Identify Subnet Requirements:** By the giving an example to marketing and sales departments, suppose you decide to make subnet autonomous and that every host should be in an own segment; then you must figure out the number of hosts in each department's segment. This data will allow you to find amount of bits in the subnet mask, and later use this information to determine the subnet sized for each segment.\n\n### **Choose Initial Subnet**\n\n- **Start with Largest Subnet:** In fact, the logical comprising the first be considered is subnet with less available Implement a subnet mask so that it could provide hosts addresses numerous is this subnet. The added amount that includes macro and local network should also be considered when calculating the total number of IPv4 addresses available.\n- **Assign IP Addresses:** Keep in mind that once you select the subnet, you should IP addresses between the present host and the network segment they are connected to, however each host has to have an unique [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) within the subnet range.\n\n### **Subnet the Subnet**\n\n- **Identify Next Largest Subnet:** Firstly need to find the required number of host, which is the biggest size of prefix, and secondly assign a suitable subnet masks for the next network.\n- **Assign IP Addresses:** Make the journey while assigning IP addresses to hosts in the subnet that has been segmented; assure that there are enough of unique IP address per host in a single subnet for each ho\n\n### **Configure Routers**\n\n- **Update Routing Tables:** Structure the router configuration such that the latest subnets and masks always stay in the network radars. Routing tables must be stored as with the created routes. The only difference is that exclusion happens only for the subnets allocated for new network.\n- **Implement Routing Protocols:** If you are involving devices which employ protocols like OSPF and EIGRP for file transfer, you may create network maps publicly so that all the devices can receive the newly updated subnets.\n\n### **Test and Verify**\n\n- **Connectivity Testing:** Lastly, make sure that you have made the subnets and have routers running. You need to do this before running connectivity checks to make sure that the hosts in the same subnet can reach with other hosts in the [subnet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/).\n- **Troubleshooting:** If there are any challenges in any kind of test, such as connection issues, try to identify the problem in particular area of the network design that the issue is from and resolve it by the way of a connection problem or misconfiguration solver.\n\n### **Document the Configuration**\n\n- **Document Subnet Details:** Maintain network infrastructure through detailed documentation. Examples; Subnet masking, IP address ranges, and number of hosts in each subnet is also important.\n- **Update Network Diagrams:** The network diagrams need to be updated in accordance with the newly added subnet structure, including the connections between different subnets and how the routes operate with each other.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nAll of the above is encoded with Virtual Mask Subnet Length , VLSM, another superior IP networking method that may be utilized to maximize the efficient utilization of IP address space by offering address space for subnets of varying sizes. By programing the address to have the number of IPs necessary for each subnet, maximized access to addressing space might be achieved to save you money. As networks have multiplied into greater and more intricate topologies, VLSM has stayed critical since it allows network administrators to create a well-thought-out IP address assignment strategy.\n\n## **Frequently Asked Questions on VLSM in IP Networking - FAQs**\n\n### **Can VLSM be used in IPv6 networks?**\n\n> Even though VLSM was at the beginning of the IPv4 networks, the same principles can be used in IPv6 networks where CIDR is also possible. IPv6 is already offering a huge address space which makes the optimization of subnet unnecessary as it is less urgent than IPv4. Nonetheless, the idea of variable-length subnetting is still a matter of concern in IPv6 networks, because the subnet can adjust the size of the subnets according to the needs of the particular users **.**\n\n### **Does VLSM require special hardware or software?**\n\n> VLSM implementation usually does not demand any additional hardware, but routers and other network devices must support CIDR (Classless Inter-domain Routing) for the correct functioning. The majority of the current networking tools and software are providing support to CIDR and hence the VLSM can be used by organizations without any additional infrastructure investments. Nevertheless, it's necessary to make sure that the VLSM is compatible with CIDR when you are designing the plan for the VLSM implementation so as not to face any compatibility issues.\n\n### **Is VLSM suitable for all types of networks?**\n\n> VLSM is particularly useful for big networks where the subnet size varies, it can as well be used in smaller networks to increase the efficiency and scalability. The VLSM shines because it can adapt to various network architectures and requirements, thus it is a very good solution for the optimization of the IP addresses allocation and the network design on a large scale of the networks with different sizes and configurations.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction of Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-variable-length-subnet-mask-vlsm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/btnai2c75q544e1wsxy2)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/varshneyrajat57/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[varshneyrajat57](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/varshneyrajat57/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Networks-IP Addressing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/computer-networks-ip-addressing/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Virtual Length Subnet Mask (VLSM ) in IP Networking\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nVLSM is an IP routing technique that is applied for optimal use of the available Internet Protocol address space.

In subnetting, a single big network is divided into multiple smaller subnetworks. In Supernetting, multiple networks are combined into a bigger network termed a Supernetwork or Supernet. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the purpose and advantages of supernetting, along with essential considerations for its implementation.\n\n## What is Supernetting?\n\nSupernetting is the process of aggregating routes to multiple smaller networks. Thus saving storage space in the routing table, simplifying routing decisions, and reducing route advertisements to neighboring [gateways](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-gateways/). Supernetting has helped address the increasing size of [routing tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) as the Internet has expanded. Supernetting is mainly used in Route Summarization, where routes to multiple networks with similar network prefixes are combined into a single routing entry, with the routing entry pointing to a Super network, encompassing all the networks. This in turn significantly reduces the size of routing tables and also the size of routing updates exchanged by routing protocols.\n\nMore specifically,\n\n- When multiple networks are combined to form a bigger network, it is termed super-netting\n- Super netting is used in route aggregation to reduce the size of routing tables and routing table updates\n\n## Important Points for Supernetting\n\n- All the Networks should be contiguous.\n- The block size of every network should be equal and must be in form of 2n.\n- First Network id should be exactly divisible by whole size of supernet.\n\n\n**Example:** Suppose 4 small networks of class C:\n\n```\n200.1.0.0,\n200.1.1.0,\n200.1.2.0,\n200.1.3.0\n\n```\n\nBuild a bigger network that has a single Network Id.\n\n**Explanation:** Before Supernetting routing table will look like as:\n\n| Network Id | Subnet Mask | Interface |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 200.1.0.0 | 255.255.255.0 | A |\n| 200.1.1.0 | 255.255.255.0 | B |\n| 200.1.2.0 | 255.255.255.0 | C |\n| 200.1.3.0 | 255.255.255.0 | D |\n\nFirst, let\u2019s check whether three conditions are satisfied or not:\n\n- **Contiguous:** You can easily see that all networks are contiguous all having size 256 [IP Addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/)( or 254 Hosts )..\n\nRange of first Network from 200.1.0.0 to 200.1.0.255. If you add 1 in last IP address of first network that is 200.1.0.255 + 0.0.0.1, you will get the next network id which is 200.1.1.0. Similarly, check that all network are contiguous.\n- **Equal size of all network:** As all networks are of [class C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/), so all of them have a size of 256 which is in turn equal to 28.\n- **First IP address exactly divisible by total size:** When a binary number is divided by 2n then last n bits are the remainder. Hence in order to prove that first IP address is exactly divisible by while size of Supernet Network. You can check that if last n (n here refers to the number of bits required to represent the Total Size of the Supernet) bits are 0 or not.\n\nIn the given example first IP is 200.1.0.0 and whole size of supernet is 4\\*28 = 210. If last 10 bits of first IP address are zero then IP will be divisible.\n\n![Supernet example](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/11001000-1.jpg)\n\nLast 10 bits of first IP address are zero (highlighted by green color). So 3rd condition is also satisfied.\n\n## **Advantages of Supernetting**\n\n- Control and reduce network traffic\n- Helpful to solve the problem of lacking IP addresses\n- Minimizes the routing table\u00a0i.e, it cannot cover a different area of the network when combined\u00a0and all the networks should be in the same class and all IP should be contiguous\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, supernetting is a networking technique that consolidates multiple smaller networks into a larger one, simplifying routing and reducing the size of routing tables. It\u2019s a valuable tool in managing the growth of internet routing tables and optimizing network performance. However, it requires careful consideration of network characteristics and adherence to specific conditions for effective implementation.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### **Q.1**: **Can supernetting be used in IPv6 networks, or is it primarily for IPv4?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Supernetting can be used in both [IPv4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) and [IPv6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6/) networks. While it\u2019s more commonly associated with IPv4 due to its longer adoption history, the principles apply to both IP versions.\n\n### **Q.2**: **Can supernetting be applied in cloud-based or virtualized networks?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Yes, supernetting principles can be applied to cloud-based and virtualized networks to optimize routing and reduce the complexity of routing tables, improving overall network performance.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-subnetting/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction To Subnetting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-subnetting/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/ulmznubnobhiz0z1djao)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/himanshukumarpatel/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[himanshukumarpatel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/himanshukumarpatel/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Nowadays, individuals are more connected on the internet and hence, the need to use Routing Communication is essential.\n\nRouting chooses the routes along which Internet Protocol (IP) packets get from their source to their destination in packet-switching networks. This article will discuss the details of the Routing Process along with its different types and working principles.\n\n## What is a Router?\n\nRouters are specialized pieces of network hardware that make these judgments about Internet routing. It is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Also, it helps to direct traffic based on the destination [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/). It ensures that data reaches its intended destination.\n\nAs the router connects different networks, it manages data traffic between them. The Router operates at Layer 3 (the network layer) of the [OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/). It is also responsible for determining the best path for data to travel from one network to another.\n\n## What is Routing?\n\nRouting refers to the process of directing a data packet from one node to another. It is an autonomous process handled by the network devices to direct a data packet to its intended destination. Note that, the node here refers to a [network device](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/) called - ' [Router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/)'.\n\nRouting is a crucial mechanism that transmits data from one location to another across a network (Network type could be any like [LAN, WAN, or MAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/)). The process of routing involves making various routing decisions to ensure reliable & efficient delivery of the data packet by finding the shortest path using various routing metrics which we will be discussing in this article.\n\nRouting of a data packet is done by analyzing the destination IP Address of the packet. Look at the below image:\n\n![Packet-1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231127222035/Packet-1.png)Routing of packets\n\n- The Source Node (Sender) sends the data packet on the network, embedding the IP in the header of the data packet.\n- The nearest router receives the data packet, and based on some metrics, further routes the data packet to other routers.\n- Step 2 occurs recursively till the data packet reaches its intended destination.\n\n**Note:** There are limits to how many hop counts a packet can do if it is exceeded, the packet is considered to be lost.\n\n## What are Different Types of Routing?\n\nRouting is typically of 3 types, each serving its purpose and offering different functionalities.\n\n![Types-of-Routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231130224032/Types-of-Routing.png)Types of Routing\n\n### 1\\. Static Routing\n\nStatic routing is also called as \"non-adaptive routing\". In this, routing configuration is done manually by the network administrator. Let's say for example, we have 5 different routes to transmit data from one node to another, so the network administrator will have to manually enter the routing information by assessing all the routes.\n\n- A network administrator has full control over the network, routing the data packets to their concerned destinations\n- Routers will route packets to the destination configured manually by the network administrator.\n- Although this type of routing gives fine-grained control over the routes, it may not be suitable for large-scale enterprise networks.\n\n### 2\\. Dynamic Routing\n\nDynamic Routing is another type of routing in which routing is an autonomous procedure without any human intervention. Packets are transmitted over a network using various shortest-path algorithms and pre-determined metrics. This type of routing is majorly preferred in modern networks as it offers more flexibility and versatile functionality.\n\n- It is also known as adaptive routing.\n- In this, the router adds new routes to the routing table based on any changes made in the topology of the network.\n- The autonomous procedure of routing helps in automating every routing operation from adding to removing a route upon updates or any changes made to the network.\n\n### 3\\. Default Routing\n\nDefault Routing is a routing technique in which a router is configured to transmit packets to a default route that is, a [gateway](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/default-gateway-in-networking/) or next-hop device if no specific path is defined or found. It is commonly used when the network has a single exit point. The IP Router has the following address as the default route: 0.0.0.0/0.\n\n## What is the Working Principle of Routing?\n\nRouting works by finding the shortest path from the source node to the destination node across a network. Here's the step-by-step working of routing:\n\n### **Step 1: Communication initiation**\n\nThe first step that typically happens is, one node (client or server) initiates a communication across a network using [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) protocols.\n\n### **Step 2: Data Packets**\n\nThe source device now breaks a big chunk of information into small data packets for reliable and efficient transmission. This process is called de-assembling and encapsulating the data payload. Then each data packet is labeled with the destination node's IP address.\n\n### **Step 3: Routing Table**\n\nThe [Routing table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) is a logical [data structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structure-meaning/) used to store the IP addresses and relevant information regarding the nearest routers. The source node then looks up the IP addresses of all the nodes that can transmit the packet to its destination selects the shortest path using the shortest path algorithm and then routes accordingly.\n\nThe Routing Table is stored in a router, a network device that determines the shortest path and routes the data packet.\n\n### Step 4: Hopping procedure\n\nIn the procedure or routing, the data packet will undergo many hops across various nodes in a network till it reaches its final destination node. Hop count is defined as the number of nodes required to traverse through to finally reach the intended destination node.\n\nThis hopping procedure has certain criteria defined for every data packet, there's a limited number of hops a packet can take if the packet exceeds that, then it's considered to be lost and is retransmitted.\n\n### Step 5: Reaching the destination node\n\nOnce all the data packets reach their intended destination node, they re-assemble and transform into complete information that was sent by the sender (source node). The receiver will perform various [error-checking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/) mechanisms to verify the authenticity of the data packets.\n\nOverall, the data packet will be transmitted over the least hop-count path as well as the path on which there is less traffic to prevent packet loss.\n\n![Routing-Working](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231130220555/Routing-Working.png)Working of Routing\n\nIn the above image, we have 3 major components\n\n- Sender\n- Receiver\n- Routers\n\nThe shortest path is highlighted in red, the path with the least hop count. As we can see, there are multiple paths from source to node but if all the appropriate metrics are satisfied, the data packets will be transmitted through the shortest path (highlighted in red).\n\n## What are the Main Routing Protocols?\n\n- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** It is a distance-vector protocol that uses hop count as a metric.\n- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** OSPF is a link-state protocol that finds the shortest path using the Dijkstra algorithm.\n- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** It is a hybrid protocol that combines features of distance-vector and link-state.\n- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** It is a path-vector protocol that is used for routing between different autonomous systems on the internet.\n- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** It is a link-state protocol that is primarily used in large networks like ISPs.\n\n## What are Different Routing Metrics?\n\nThe purpose of routing protocols is to learn about all the available paths to route data packets, build routing tables, and make routing decisions based on specified metrics. There are two primary types of routing protocols rest of them ideate from these two only.\n\n### 1\\. Distance Vector Routing\n\nIn this type of routing protocol, all the nodes that are a part of the network advertise their routing table to their adjacent nodes (nodes that are directly connected) at regular intervals. With each router getting updated at regular intervals, it may take time for all the nodes to have the same accurate network view.\n\n- Uses fixed length sub-net, not suitable for scaling.\n- Algorithm used: [Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/) to find the shortest path.\n\n### 2\\. Link State Routing\n\nLink State Routing is another type of dynamic routing protocol in which routes advertise their updated routing tables only when some new updates are added. This results in the effective use of bandwidth. All the routers keep exchanging information dynamically regarding different links such as cost and hop count to find the best possible path.\n\n- Uses a variable length subnet mask, which is scalable and uses addressing more effectively.\n- The algorithm used: [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/) to find the shortest path.\n\nLet's look at the metrics used to measure the cost of travel from one node to another:-\n\n1. **Hop Count:** Hop count refers to the number of nodes a data packet has to traverse to reach its intended destination. Transmitting from one node to another node counts as 1 - hop count. The goal is to minimize the hop count and find the shortest path.\n2. **Bandwidth Consumption:** Bandwidth is the ability of a network to transmit data typically measured in [Kbps (Kilobits per second)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-kilobytes-per-secondkbps/), [Mbps (Megabits per second)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-megabits-per-second-mbps/), or [Gbps (Gigabits per second)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-gbps/). The bandwidth depends on several factors such as - the volume of data, traffic on a network, network speed, etc. Routing decision is made in a way to ensure efficient bandwidth consumption.\n3. **Delay:** Delay is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from the source node to its destination node. There are different types of delay such as - propagation delay, transmission delay, and queuing delay.\n4. **Load:** Load refers to the network traffic on a certain path in the context of routing. A data packet will be routed to the path with a lesser load so that it reaches its destination in the specified time.\n5. **Reliability:** Reliability refers to the assured delivery of the data packet to its intended destination although there are certain other factors, the data packet is routed in such a way that it reaches its destination. The stability and availability of the link in the network are looked over before routing the data packet from a specific path.\n\n## What are the Advantages of Routing?\n\n- Overall routing can be done in various ways its important to know the requirements and use the one that fits right for our specific needs, hence automated routing is typically preferred as the routing of packets is done by the algorithms defined and the manually configurable routing can give us a fine-grained control over the network.\n- Routing is a highly scalable operation for transmitting data that is, in a large-scale enterprise network it becomes crucial to manage information related to all the nodes that may be sharing sensitive and confidential information regarding the organization.\n- Load Balancing is also one of the crucial aspects taken care of by routing data packets off the routes that are generally busy as sending data through those routes will only put our data at risk of getting lost.\n\n## What are the Disadvantages of Routing?\n\nEvery type of routing comes with some pros and cons here are some of the disadvantages for specific types of routing :\n\n- Static Routing: This type of routing is appropriate only for smaller networks where the network administrator has an accurate view of the network & good knowledge of topology else it might raise some security concerns and complex configuration issues.\n- Dynamic Routing: Everything is done automatically by the algorithms, providing less control over the network that may not be suitable for every kind of network. It is also computationally expensive and consumes more bandwidth.\n- Default Routing: The path on which the packets are to be transmitted by default is configurable but can be a complex procedure if not defined clearly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRouting is a fundamental concept in computer science that allows every network device across the world to share data across the internet. Here, the shortest path is selected by the routing algorithms when routing a data packet. So, the Routing Algorithms select the shortest path based on metrics like - hop count, delay, bandwidth, etc.\n\n## What is Routing - FAQs\n\n### What are routing examples?\n\n> Traffic in a road system is an example of routing, in which driver picks a selected path that reduces their travel time.\n\n### How does a router work?\n\n> Routes examine the IP in the header of every data packet received and if it belongs to it then it keeps the data packet else it re-routes it to another router based on some metrics.\n\n### What is a Default Gateway?\n\n> The default gateway is simply a router or another network device that allows the host to connect with other networks outside its local network. It is a crucial component of internetwork communication.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ip-routing/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is IP Routing?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ip-routing/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/wcdnswbga25qce70c7e5)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/dotslash_adwitiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[dotslash\\_adwitiya](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/dotslash_adwitiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2023/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Routing?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe process of choosing a path across one or more networks is known as Network Routing.

Effective routing ensures that data is transferred across networks in an efficient, reliable, and timely manner. There are two main forms of routing: static and dynamic. In this article, we will discuss the differences between static and dynamic routing.\n\n## **What is Static Routing?**\n\n[Static Routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-routing/) is also known as **non-adaptive** routing which doesn\u2019t change the routing table unless the network administrator changes or modifies them manually. Static routing does not use complex routing algorithms and It provides higher or more security than dynamic routing.\n\n![Static routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190517214641/Untitled-Diagram-103.png)\n\n### **Advantages of Static Routing**\n\n- No routing overhead for the router [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-cpu-and-gpu/) which means a cheaper router can be used to do routing.\n- It adds security because only an only administrator can allow routing to particular networks only.\n- No bandwidth usage between routers.\n\n### **Disadvantage\u00a0of Static Routing**\n\n- For a large network, it is a hectic task for administrators to manually add each route for the network in the [routing table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) on each router.\n- The administrator should have good knowledge of the topology. If a new administrator comes, then he has to manually add each route so he should have very good knowledge of the routes of the topology.\n\n## **What is Dynamic Routing?**\n\nDynamic routing is also known as **adaptive** routing which changes the routing table according to the change in topology. [Dynamic routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-routing-in-computer-network/) uses complex routing algorithms and it does not provide high security like static routing. When the network change(topology) occurs, it sends the message to the router to ensure that changes then the routes are recalculated for sending updated routing information.\n\n![Dynamic Routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190517214708/Untitled-Diagram-1110.png)\n\n### **Advantages\u00a0of Dynamic Routing**\n\n- Easy to configure.\n- More effective at selecting the best route to a destination remote network and also for discovering remote networks.\n\n### **Disadvantage\u00a0of Dynamic Routing**\n\n- Consumes more [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) for communicating with other neighbors.\n- Less secure than static routing.\n\n## **Difference between Static and Dynamic Routing**\n\n**Static routing and dynamic routing** are two fundamental concepts in network communication. Static routing uses preconfigured paths, while dynamic routing automatically adjusts paths based on current network conditions.\n\n| Static Routing | Dynamic Routing |\n| --- | --- |\n| In static routing routes are user-defined. | In dynamic routing, routes are updated according to the topology. |\n| Static routing does not use complex routing algorithms. | Dynamic routing uses complex routing algorithms. |\n| Static routing provides high or more security. | Dynamic routing provides less security. |\n| Static routing is manual. | Dynamic routing is automated. |\n| Static routing is implemented in small networks. | Dynamic routing is implemented in large networks. |\n| In static routing, additional resources are not required. | In dynamic routing, additional resources are required. |\n| In static routing, failure of the link disrupts the rerouting. | In dynamic routing, failure of the link does not interrupt the rerouting. |\n| Less [Bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) is required in Static Routing. | More Bandwidth is required in Dynamic Routing. |\n| Static Routing is difficult to configure. | Dynamic Routing is easy to configure. |\n| Another name for static routing is non-adaptive routing. | Another name for dynamic routing is adaptive routing. |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRouting is crucial that allows every network device across the world to share data with each other across internet. Shortest path is selected by the routing algorithms when routing a data packet. Routing Algorithms select the shortest path based on metrics like \u2013 hop count, delay, bandwidth etc. The core network device used in routing is router. Routes are stored in a logical data structure called \u2013 [\u2018 **Routing Table**\u2018.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) Static routing is a process in which we have to manually add routes to the routing table while In Dynamic Routing packets are transmitted over a network using various shortest path algorithms and pre-determined metrics.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Static and Dynamic Routing \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Why is static routing preferred?\n\n> Because Static routing has zero overhead.\n\n### Is dynamic routing Automatic?\n\n> When you enable a dynamic routing protocol, the corresponding dynamic routing protocol is automatically generated.\n\n### Which protocol uses dynamic routing?\n\n> [OSPF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-states/) and [RIP.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-floating-static-route/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Floating Static Route ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-floating-static-route/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MKS075/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[MKS075](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MKS075/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n37\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Difference Between](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/difference-between/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

It is a point-to-point communication between the sender and receiver. There are various unicast protocols such as TCP, HTTP, etc.\n\n- [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) (Transmission Control Protocol) is the most commonly used unicast protocol. It is a connection-oriented protocol that relies on acknowledgment from the receiver side.\n- [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is an object-oriented protocol for communication.\n\n![Unicast Routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/UNICAST-1.png)\n\nUnicast Routing\n\n## Major Protocols of Unicast Routing\n\n1. **Distance Vector Routing:** Distance-Vector routers use a distributed algorithm to compute their routing tables.\n2. **Link-State Routing:** Link-State routing uses link-state routers to exchange messages that allow each router to learn the entire network topology.\n3. **Path-Vector Routing:** It is a routing protocol that maintains the path that is updated dynamically.\n\n## Link State Routing\n\nLink state routing is the second family of routing protocols. While distance-vector routers use a distributed algorithm to compute their routing tables, link-state routing uses link-state routers to exchange messages that allow each router to learn the entire network topology. Based on this learned topology, each router is then able to compute its routing table by using the shortest path computation.\n\nLink state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its neighborhood with every other router i.e. the internet work. The three keys to understand the link state routing algorithm.\n\n1. **Knowledge about the neighborhood** : Instead of sending its routing table, a router sends the information about its neighborhood only. A router broadcast its identities and cost of the directly attached links to other routers.\n2. **Flooding:** Each router sends the information to every other router on the internetwork except its neighbors. This process is known as flooding. Every router that receives the packet sends the copies to all the neighbors. Finally each and every router receives a copy of the same information.\n3. **Information Sharing** : A router send the information to every other router only when the change occurs in the information.\n\n**Link state routing has two phase:**\n\n1. **Reliable Flooding: Initial state** \u2013 Each node knows the cost of its neighbors. Final state- Each node knows the entire graph.\n2. **Route Calculation** : Each node uses Dijkstra\u2019 s algorithm on the graph to calculate the optimal routes to all nodes. The link state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm which is used to find the shortest path from one node to every other node in the network.\n\n## Features of Link State Routing Protocols\n\n- **Link State Packet:** A small packet that contains routing information.\n- **Link-State Database:** A collection of information gathered from the link-state packet.\n- **Shortest Path First Algorithm (Dijkstra algorithm):** A calculation performed on the database results in the shortest path\n- **Routing Table:** A list of known paths and interfaces.\n\n## Calculation of Shortest Path\n\nTo find the shortest path, each node needs to run the famous [Dijkstra algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/). Let us understand how can we find the shortest path using an example.\n\n**Note:** We use a boolean array **sptSet\\[\\]** to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value **sptSet\\[v\\]** is true, then vertex v is included in SPT, otherwise not. Array **dist\\[\\]** is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.\n\nConsider the below graph and src = 0.\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175419/Unicast-routing-1.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 1\n\n**STEP 1:** The set sptSet is initially empty and distances assigned to vertices are {0, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF, INF} where INF indicates infinite. Now pick the vertex with a minimum distance value. The vertex 0 is picked and included in sptSet. So sptSet becomes {0}. After including 0 to sptSet, update the distance values of its adjacent vertices. Adjacent vertices of 0 are 1 and 7. The distance values of 1 and 7 are updated as 4 and 8.\n\nThe following subgraph shows vertices and their distance values. Vertices included in SPT are included in GREEN color.\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175447/Unicast-routing-2-2.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 2\n\n**STEP 2:** Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). The vertex 1 is picked and added to sptSet. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 1. The distance value of vertex 2 becomes 12.\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175505/Unicast-routing-2-3.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 3\n\n**STEP 3:** Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 7 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 7. The distance value of vertex 6 and 8 becomes finite (15 and 9 respectively).\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 4](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175521/Unicast-routing-2-4.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 4\n\n**STEP 4:** Pick the vertex with minimum distance value and not already included in SPT (not in sptSET). Vertex 6 is picked. So sptSet now becomes {0, 1, 7, 6}. Update the distance values of adjacent vertices of 6. The distance value of vertex 5 and 8 are updated.\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 5](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175539/Unicast-routing-2-5.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 5\n\nWe repeat the above steps until sptSet includes all vertices of the given graph. Finally, we get the following Shortest Path Tree (SPT).\n\n![Shortest Path Calculation - Step 6](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230327175555/Unicast-routing-2-6.png)\n\nShortest Path Calculation \u2013 Step 6\n\n## Characteristics of Link State Protocol\n\n- It requires a large amount of memory.\n- Shortest path computations require many CPU circles.\n- If a network uses little bandwidth; it quickly reacts to topology changes\n- All items in the database must be sent to neighbors to form link-state packets.\n- All neighbors must be trusted in the topology.\n- Authentication mechanisms can be used to avoid undesired adjacency and problems.\n- No split horizon techniques are possible in the link-state routing.\n- OSPF\u00a0Protocol\n\n## Protocols of Link State Routing\n\n1. [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-fundamentals/)\n2. Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)\n\n**Open Shortest Path First (OSPF):** Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a unicast routing protocol developed by a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is an intradomain routing protocol. It is an open-source protocol. It is similar to Routing Information Protocol (RIP). OSPF is a classless routing protocol, which means that in its updates, it includes the subnet of each route it knows about, thus, enabling variable-length subnet masks. With variable-length subnet masks, an IP network can be broken into many subnets of various sizes. This provides network administrators with extra network configuration flexibility. These updates are multicasts at specific addresses (224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6). OSPF is implemented as a program in the network layer using the services provided by the Internet Protocol. IP datagram that carries the messages from OSPF sets the value of the protocol field to 89. OSPF is based on the SPF algorithm, which sometimes is referred to as the Dijkstra algorithm.\n\n**Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS):** Intermediate System to Intermediate System is a standardized link-state protocol that was developed as the definitive routing protocol for the OSI Model. IS-IS uses System ID to identify a router on the network. IS-IS doesn\u2019t require IP connectivity between the routers as updates are sent via CLNS instead of IP.\n\nFor more about OSPF and IS-IS, you can refer to [Difference between OSPF and IS-IS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ospf-and-is-is/).\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/distance-vector-routing-dvr-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/distance-vector-routing-dvr-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AniketSingh1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[AniketSingh1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AniketSingh1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n41\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Each router keeps a table that shows the shortest distance to every other router, based on the number of hops (or steps) needed to reach them. Routers share this information with their neighbors, allowing them to update their tables and find the most efficient routes. This protocol helps ensure that data moves quickly and smoothly through the network.\n\n## What is the Distance Vector Routing Algorithm?\n\nThe protocol requires that a router inform its neighbors of topology changes periodically. Historically known as the old [ARPANET](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arpanet-full-form/) routing algorithm (or known as the [Bellman-Ford algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-simple-implementation/)).\n\n### **Bellman-Ford Basics**\n\nEach router maintains a Distance Vector table containing the distance between itself and All possible destination nodes. Distances, based on a chosen metric, are computed using information from the neighbors\u2019 distance vectors.\n\n```\nInformation kept by DV router:\nEach router has an IDAssociated with each link connected to a router,\nthere is a link cost (static or dynamic).Intermediate hops\nDistance Vector Table Initialization:Distance to itself = 0Distance to ALL other routers = infinity number.\n```\n\ncovers these protocols extensively.\n\n## **How Distance Vector Algorithm works?**\n\n- A [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) transmits its distance vector to each of its neighbors in a routing packet.\n- Each router receives and saves the most recently received distance vector from each of its neighbors.\n- A router recalculates its distance vector when:\n  - It receives a distance vector from a neighbor containing different information than before.\n  - It discovers that a link to a neighbor has gone down.\n\nThe DV calculation is based on minimizing the cost to each destination\n\n```\nDx(y) = Estimate of least cost from x to y\nC(x,v) =  Node x knows cost to each neighbor v\nDx   =  [Dx(y): y ? N ] = Node x maintains distance vector\nNode x also maintains its neighbors' distance vectors\n\u2013 For each neighbor v, x maintains Dv = [Dv(y): y ? N ]\n\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n- From time-to-time, each node sends its own distance vector estimate to neighbors.\n- When a node x receives new DV estimate from any neighbor v, it saves v\u2019s distance vector and it updates its own DV using B-F equation:\n\n```\nDx(y) = min { C(x,v) + Dv(y), Dx(y) } for each node y ? N\n\n```\n\n\n**Example :**\n\nConsider 3-routers X, Y and Z as shown in figure. Each router have their routing table. Every routing table will contain distance to the destination nodes.\n\n![Distance Vector Routing (DVR)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/DVP1.jpg)\n\nConsider router X , X will share it routing table to neighbors and neighbors will share it routing table to it to X and distance from node X to destination will be calculated using bellmen- ford equation.\n\n```\n Dx(y) = min { C(x,v) + Dv(y)} for each node y ? N\n\n```\n\nAs we can see that distance will be less going from X to Z when Y is intermediate node(hop) so it will be update in routing table X.\n\n![Distance Vector Routing (DVR)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dvp2.jpg)\n\nSimilarly for Z also \u2013\n\n![Distance Vector Routing (DVR)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dvp3.jpg)\n\nFinally the routing table for all \u2013\n\n![Distance Vector Routing (DVR)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dvp4.jpg)\n\n## Applications of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm\n\nThe Distance Vector Routing Algorithm has several uses:\n\n- **Computer Networking** : It helps route data packets in networks.\n- **Telephone Systems** : It\u2019s used in some telephone switching systems.\n- **Military Applications** : It has been used to route missiles.\n\n## **Advantages of Distance Vector routing**\n\n- **Shortest Path** : Distance Vector Routing finds the shortest path for data to travel in a network.\n- **Usage** : It is used in local, metropolitan, and wide-area networks.\n- **Easy Implementation** : The method is simple to set up and doesn\u2019t require many resources.\n\n## Disadvantages of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm\n\n- It is slower to converge than link state.\n- It is at risk from the count-to-infinity problem.\n- It creates more traffic than link state since a hop count change must be propagated to all routers and processed on each router. Hop count updates take place on a periodic basis, even if there are no changes in the [network topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-topology/) , so [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) -wasting broadcasts still occur.\n- For larger networks, distance vector routing results in larger routing tables than link state since each router must know about all other routers. This can also lead to congestion on [WAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wan-full-form/) links.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol is a simple and efficient method for finding the shortest path for data in various types of networks. Its ease of implementation and quick adjustment to network changes make it a valuable tool for ensuring data travels quickly and efficiently. DVR Protocol helps maintain smooth network operations by constantly updating and optimizing routes.\n\n## **GATE CS Corner Questions**\n\nPracticing the following questions will help you test your knowledge.

One public IP address is needed to access the Internet but we can use multiple IP addresses in our private network and access the internet from different devices and same IP address. To achieve this, a private IP address must be translated into a public IP address.\n\n## Network Address Translation(NAT)\n\n**Network Address Translation (NAT)** is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP addresses and vice versa to provide Internet access to the local hosts. It also does the translation of port numbers, i.e., masks the port number of the host with another port number in the packet that will be routed to the destination. It then makes the corresponding entries of IP address and port number in the NAT table. NAT generally operates on a [router or firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-router-and-firewall/).\n\n![7](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203170255888522/7.jpg)\n\nNetwork Address Translation\n\n## **Working of Network Address Translation (NAT)**\n\nGenerally, the border router is configured for NAT i.e. the router which has one interface in the local (inside) network and one interface in the global (outside) network. When a packet traverse outside the local (inside) network, then NAT converts that local (private) IP address to a global (public) IP address. When a packet enters the local network, the global (public) IP address is converted to a local (private) IP address.\n\nIf NAT runs out of addresses, i.e., no address is left in the pool configured then the packets will be dropped and an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) host unreachable packet to the destination is sent.\n\n## **Why Mask Port Numbers?**\n\nSuppose, in a network, two hosts A and B are connected. Now, both of them request for the same destination, on the same port number, say 1000, on the host side, at the same time. If NAT does only translation of IP addresses, then when their packets will arrive at the NAT, both of their IP addresses would be masked by the public IP address of the network and sent to the destination. Destination will send replies to the public IP address of the router. Thus, on receiving a reply, it will be unclear to NAT as to which reply belongs to which host (because source port numbers for both A and B are the same). Hence, to avoid such a problem, NAT masks the source port number as well and makes an entry in the NAT table.\n\n## **NAT inside and outside addresses**\n\nInside refers to the addresses which must be translated. Outside refers to the addresses which are not in control of an organization. These are the network Addresses in which the translation of the addresses will be done.\n\n![Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/stati1c.png)\n\n- **Inside local address \u2013** An IP address that is assigned to a host on the Inside (local) network. The address is probably not an IP address assigned by the service provider i.e., these are private IP addresses. This is the inside host seen from the inside network.\n- **Inside global address \u2013** IP address that represents one or more inside local IP addresses to the outside world. This is the inside host as seen from the outside network.\n- **Outside local address \u2013** This is the actual IP address of the destination host in the local network after translation.\n- **Outside global address \u2013** This is the outside host as seen from the outside network. It is the IP address of the outside destination host before translation.\n\n## **Types of Network Address Translation (NAT)**\n\nThere are 3 ways to configure NAT:\n\n### **Static NAT**\n\nIn this, a single unregistered (Private) IP address is mapped with a legally registered (Public) IP address i.e one-to-one mapping between local and global addresses. This is generally used for Web hosting. These are not used in organizations as there are many devices that will need Internet access and to provide Internet access, a public IP address is needed.\n\nSuppose, if there are 3000 devices that need access to the Internet, the organization has to buy 3000 public addresses that will be very costly.\n\n### **Dynamic NAT**\n\nIn this type of NAT, an unregistered IP address is translated into a registered (Public) IP address from a pool of public IP addresses. If the IP address of the pool is not free, then the packet will be dropped as only a fixed number of private IP addresses can be translated to public addresses.\n\nSuppose, if there is a pool of 2 public IP addresses then only 2 private IP addresses can be translated at a given time. If 3rd private IP address wants to access the Internet then the packet will be dropped therefore many private IP addresses are mapped to a pool of public IP addresses. NAT is used when the number of users who want to access the Internet is fixed. This is also very costly as the organization has to buy many global IP addresses to make a pool.\n\n### **Port Address Translation (PAT)**\n\nThis is also known as NAT overload. In this, many local (private) [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) can be translated to a single registered IP address. Port numbers are used to distinguish the traffic i.e., which traffic belongs to which IP address. This is most frequently used as it is cost-effective as thousands of users can be connected to the Internet by using only one real global (public) IP address.\n\n## **Advantages of NAT**\n\n- NAT conserves legally registered IP addresses.\n- It provides privacy as the device\u2019s IP address, sending and receiving the traffic, will be hidden.\n- Eliminates address renumbering when a network evolves.\n\n## **Disadvantage of NAT**\n\n- Translation results in switching path delays.\n- Certain applications will not function while NAT is enabled.\n- Complicates tunneling protocols such as IPsec.\n- Also, the router being a network layer device, should not tamper with port numbers(transport layer) but it has to do so because of NAT.\n\nTo read about Difference Between Network Address Translation and Domain Name System, refer to this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-network-address-translation-and-domain-name-system/).\n\n## Network Address Translation (NAT) \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the primary purpose of Network Address Translation (NAT)?\n\n> The main use of NAT is mainly to enable a number of networked devices in a private network to connect to the Internet via one IP address. This saves the over depleted public IPV4 addresses and allows a certain degree of privacy be achieved by masking the internal addresses from the external network.\n\n### What is the difference between Static NAT and Dynamic NAT?\n\n> Static NAT uses a one-to-one mapping of private IP address to the public IP address as is the case with web hosting and the like. By contrast, Dynamic NAT translates private IP addresses to a range of public IP addresses, assigning one to a device as required, and is better suited for the network where the number of devices connected to the Internet, at any one time, is uncertain.\n\n### How does Port Address Translation (PAT) work, and why is it cost-effective?\n\n> PAT or NAT overload is a technique, which opens several private IP addresses, which are assigned a single public IP address each has a different number of ports through which connections can be distinguished. This makes it economical because thousands of devices can simultaneously connect to the Internet using a single public IP address and the organization will not be required to make several purchases of public IP addresses.\n\n### How Can NAT Help Transition to IPv6?\n\n> Transition from [**IPv4 to IPv6**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transition-from-ipv4-to-ipv6-address/) is difficult due to differences in address formats and network structures. **NAT (Network Address Translation)** helps IPv6 networks communicate with IPv4 networks. Intermediate solutions like **NAT64 and NAT46** enable interoperability and allows organizations to adopt IPv6 without affecting existing IPv4 services.\n\n### Is NAT an Additional Security Feature Found on a Router?\n\n> **NAT** provides basic security by hiding internal IPs behind a single public IP and reduces direct attacks on internal devices. However, it doesn\u2019t alone provide complete security and should be used with [firewalls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/) and [intrusion detection systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/intrusion-detection-system-ids/) for better protection.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cryptography-introduction/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Cryptography Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cryptography-introduction/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n131\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Data Communication Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nData communication plays an important role in today's interconnected world and enables the exchange of information between devices and networks.
