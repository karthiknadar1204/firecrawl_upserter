When working with your network systems, this protocol helps to identify specified network devices and find their addresses. Its main purpose is to duly transport data packets over the network, allowing them to move between devices connected to your heritage network.\n\nIn this article, we will give you with information about the introductory principles of ARP protocol, how it works, and its significance. We'll also tell you why [ARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) is important and how it can be used in your networking systems. Through this article, you'll gain deep knowledge of ARP protocol and make your place in the world of networking.\n\n## What is the ARP Protocol?\n\nARP stands for \u201cAddress Resolution Protocol\u201d. It is a network protocol used to determine the MAC address (hardware address) from any IP address.\n\nIn other words, ARP is used to mapping the IP Address into [MAC Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/). When one device wants to communicate with another device in a LAN (local area network) network, the [ARP protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) is used.\n\nThis protocol is used when a device wants to communicate with another device over a local area network or ethernet.\n\nARP is a network layer protocol. This is a very important protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite. Although it was developed in the early 80s, it was defined in RFC 826 in 1982. ARP is implemented with important technologies like IPv4, X.25, frame relay, and ATM.\n\nARP protocol finds the MAC address based on [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/). IP address is used to communicate with any device at the application layer. But to communicate with a device at the data link layer or to send data to it, a MAC address is required.\n\nWhen data is sent to a local host, the data travels between networks via IP address. But to reach that host in LAN, it needs the MAC address of that host. In this situation the address resolution protocol plays an important role.\n\n## Important ARP Terms\n\n- **ARP Cache :-** After receiving the MAC address, ARP passes it to the sender where it is stored in a table for future reference. And this is called ARP Cache which is later used to obtain the MAC address.\n- **ARP Cache Timeout :-** This is the time in which the [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) can remain in the [ARP Cache](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arp-command-in-linux-with-examples/).\n- **ARP request :-** Broadcasting a packet over the network to verify whether we have arrived at the destination MAC address.\n- **ARP response/reply :-** It is a MAC address response that the sender receives from the receiver which helps in further communication of data.\n\n## Types of ARP\n\nThere are four types of ARP protocol they are as follows:-\n\n1. Proxy ARP\n2. Gratuitous ARP\n3. Reverse ARP\n4. Inverse ARP\n\n### **1\\. Proxy ARP**\n\nThis is a technique through which proxy ARP in a network can answer ARP queries of IP addresses that are not in that network. That is, if we understand it in simple language, the Proxy server can also respond to queries of IP-address of other networks.\n\nThrough this we can fool the other person because instead of the [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) of the destination device, the MAC address of the proxy server is used and the other person does not even know.\n\n### **2\\. Gratuitous ARP**\n\nThis is an arp request of a host, which we use to check duplicate ip-address. And we can also use it to update the arp table of other devices. That is, through this we can check whether the host is using its original IP-address, or is using a duplicate IP-address.\n\nThis is a very important ARP. Which proves to be very helpful in protecting us from the wrong person, and by using it we can check the ip-address.\n\n### **3\\. Reverse ARP**\n\nThis is also a networking protocol, which we can use through client computer. That is, it is used to obtain information about one's own network from the computer network. That is, if understood in simple language, it is a [TCP/IP protocol w](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) hich we use to obtain information about the IP address of the computer server.\n\nThat is, to know the IP address of our computer server, we use Reverse ARP, which works under a networking protocol.\n\n### **4\\. Inverse ARP (InARP)**\n\nInverse ARP, it is the opposite of ARP, that is, we use it to know the IP address of our device through MAC Address, that is, it is such a networking technology, through this we convert MAC Address into IP address. Can translate. It is mainly used in [ATM machines](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-case-diagram-for-bank-atm-system/).\n\n## How ARP Protocol Works?\n\nBelow is a Working flow diagram of ARP Protocol\n\n![How ARP Protocol Works?](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230920161126/Untitled-drawing-(1)-(2).png)ARP Protocol\n\nBelow is the working of address resolution protocol is being explained in some steps :-\n\n- When a sender wants to communicate with a receiver, the sender first checks its ARP cache. Sender checks whether the receiver's MAC address is already present in the ARP cache or not?\n- If the receiver's MAC address is already present in the ARP cache, the sender will communicate with the receiver using that MAC address.\n- If the MAC address of the receiver device is not already present in the ARP cache, then in such a situation an ARP request message is prepared by the sender device.This message contains the MAC address of the sender, IP address of the sender and IP address of the receiver. The field containing the MAC address of the receiver is left blank because it is being searched.\n- Sender device broadcasts this ARP request message in the LAN. Because this is a broadcast message, every device connected to the LAN receives this message.\n- All devices match the receiver IP address of this request message with their own IP address. Devices whose IP address does not match drop this request message.\n- The device whose IP address matches the receiver IP address of this request message receives this message and prepares an [ARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) reply message. This is a unicast message which is sent only to the sender.\n- In ARP reply message, the sender's IP address and [MAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) address are used to send the reply message. Besides, in this message the receiver also sends its IP address and MAC address.\n- As soon as the sender device receives this ARP reply message, it updates its ARP cache with the new information (Receiver's MAC address). Now the MAC address of the receiver is present in the ARP cache of the sender. The sender can send and receive data without any problem.\n\n## Message Format of ARP Protocol\n\nMessages are sent to find the MAC address through ARP(address resolution protocol). These messages are broadcast to all the devices in the LAN. The format of this message is being shown in the diagram below :\n\n![ARP-Message-Format-GFG](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230920170439/ARP-Message-Format-GFG.jpeg)Message format of ARP\n\nAll the fields given in ARP message format are being explained in detail below:-\n\n- **Hardware Type:** The size of this field is 2 bytes. This field defines what type of Hardware is used to transmit the message. The most common Hardware type is Ethernet. The value of Ethernet is 1.\n- **Protocol Type:** This field tells which protocol has been used to transmit the message. substantially the value of this field is 2048 which indicates IPv4.\n- **Hardware Address Length:** It shows the length of the tackle address in bytes. The size of Ethernet MAC address is 6 bytes.\n- **Protocol Address Length:** It shows the size of the IP address in [bytes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-file-sizes-bytes-kb-mb-gb-tb-pb-eb-zb-yb/). The size of IP address is 4 bytes.\n- **OP law:** This field tells the type of message. If the value of this field is 1 also it's a request message and if the value of this field is 2 also it's a reply message.\n- **Sender Hardware Address:** This field contains the MAC address of the device transferring the message.\n- **Sender Protocol Address:** This field contains the IP address of the device transferring the message.\n- **Target Hardware Address:** This field is empty in the request message. This field contains the MAC address of the entering device.\n- **Target Protocol Address:** This field contains the IP address of the entering device.\n\n## Advantages of ARP Protocol\n\nThere are many Advantages of ARP protocol but below we have told you about some important advantages.\n\n- By using this protocol we can easily find out the MAC Address of the device.\n- There is no need to configure the end nodes at all to extract the MAC address through this protocol.\n- Through this protocol we can easily translate IP address into MAC Address.\n- There are four main types of this protocol. Which we can use in different ways, and they prove to be very helpful.\n\n## FAQs On ARP Protocol\n\n### Q.1: What's ARP protocol?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> The ARP protocol is a network dispatches(communication) protocol that establishes a mapping between IP addresses and MAC addresses. This allows one device to know the MAC address of another device when it wants to communicate with the other device. The ARP protocol works on a Local area network( LAN).\n\n### Q.2: What's ARP Cache?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> ARP Cache is a table in a device's memory where the mapping of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses is stored. This device can rapidly find out the MAC address for communication, without which ARP requests don't have to be transferred every time. The entry in ARP Cache remains valid for a limited time and is refreshed from time to time.\n\n### Q.3: What's ARP Poisoning and what are its consequences?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> ARP Poisoning is a cyber attack methodology where an attacker can change the MAC address mapping of other bias by transferring fake ARP packets in the network. With this the attacker can block network congestion and steal sensitive information. This affects network security and network head (directors) must remain watchful to help(prevent) similar damage.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hrma-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[HRMA protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hrma-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rajpootveerendrasingh36/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[rajpootveerendrasingh36](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rajpootveerendrasingh36/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2023/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[ARP Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is an important protocol that plays an important role in the networking world.

It is the reverse of the more commonly used Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which maps an IP address to a MAC address. In this article, we will discuss every point about RARP.\n\n## What is Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)?\n\nReverse ARP is a network protocol a client machine uses in a local area network to request its [Internet Protocol address (IPv4)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) from the gateway router\u2019s ARP table. The network administrator creates a table in the gateway router, which maps the MAC address to the corresponding IP address. When a new machine is set up or any machine which doesn\u2019t have amemory to store the IP address, needs an IP address for its use. So the machine sends a RARP broadcast packet which contains its own [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) in both the sender and receiver hardware address fields.\n\n![RARP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200417181217/rarpF.png)\n\nRARP is a protocol based on computer networking which is employed by a client computer to request its IP address from a gateway server\u2019s Address Resolution Protocol table or cache. The network administrator creates a table in gateway-router, which is used to map the MAC address to corresponding [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-classful-ip-addressing/).\u00a0This protocol is used to communicate data between two points in a server. The client doesn\u2019t necessarily need prior knowledge the server identities capable of serving its request. Media Access Control ( [MAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/)) addresses requires individual configuration on the servers done by an administrator. RARP limits to the serving of IP addresses only.\n\n## How does RARP Work?\n\nThe RARP is on the [Network Access Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) and is employed to send data between two points in a very network.\u00a0Each network participant has two unique addresses IP address (a logical address) and MAC address (the physical address).\u00a0 The IP address gets assigned by software and after that the MAC address is constructed into the hardware.\u00a0The RARP server that responds to RARP requests, can even be any normal computer within the network. However, it must hold the data of all the MAC addresses with their assigned IP addresses. If a RARP request is received by the network, only these RARP servers can reply to it. The info packet needs to be sent on very cheap layers of the network. This implies that the packet is transferred to all the participants at the identical time.\u00a0The client broadcasts a RARP request with an [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/) broadcast address and with its own physical address. The server responds by informing the client its IP address.\n\n## **Difference between RARP vs ARP**\n\n| RARP | ARP |\n| --- | --- |\n| A protocol used to map a physical (MAC) address to an IP address | A protocol used to map an IP address to a physical (MAC) address |\n| To obtain the IP address of a network device when only its MAC address is known | To obtain the MAC address of a network device when only its IP address is known |\n| Client broadcasts its MAC address and requests an IP address, and the server responds with the corresponding IP address | Client broadcasts its IP address and requests a MAC address, and the server responds with the corresponding MAC address |\n| MAC addresses | IP addresses |\n| Rarely used in modern networks as most devices have a pre-assigned IP address | Widely used in modern networks to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses |\n| RFC 903 Standardization | RFC 826 Standardization |\n| RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol | ARP stands for [Address Resolution Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) |\n| In RARP, we find our own IP address | In ARP, we find the IP address of a remote machine |\n| The MAC address is known and the IP address is requested | The IP address is known, and the MAC address is being requested |\n| It uses the value 3 for requests and 4 for responses | It uses the value 1 for requests and 2 for responses |\n\n## **Disadvantages of RARP**\n\n- The RARP server must be located within the same physical network.\n- The computer sends the RARP request on very cheap layer of the network. Thus, it\u2019s unattainable for a [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) to forward the packet because the computer sends the RARP request on very cheap layer of the network.\n- The RARP cannot handle the subnetting process because no subnet masks are sent. If the network is split into multiple subnets, a RARP server must be available with each of them.\n- It isn\u2019t possible to configure the PC in a very modern network.\n- It doesn\u2019t fully utilize the potential of a network like Ethernet.\n\nRARP has now become an obsolete protocol since it operates at low level. Due to this, it requires direct address to the network which makes it difficult to build a server.\n\n## Is RARP Obsolete? If so, What Alternatives Exist?\n\nYes, Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is considered obsolete.\u00a0It has been largely replaced by more advanced protocols such as the Bootstrap Protocol ( [BOOTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-protocol-bootp/)) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ( [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/)).\n\n### **Alternatives to RARP**\n\n- **Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP):** [BOOTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bootstrap-protocol-bootp/) was developed to overcome the limitations of RARP. It allows a network device to obtain an IP address, as well as other configuration information, from a BOOTP server.\n- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):** [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) is an extension of BOOTP and is widely used today. It provides a more comprehensive solution for dynamically assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.\n\nBoth BOOTP and DHCP offer greater flexibility and functionality compared to RARP, making them the preferred choices in modern networking environments.\n\n## **Issues in RARP**\n\n- Limited scalability\n- Security concerns\n- Lack of flexibility\n- Limited support\n- Compatibility issues\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRARP is specified in RFC 903 and operates at the network layer of the [OSI model.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) RARP played an important role in the development of computer networking protocols and continues to be used in certain contexts. While RARP was widely used in the past, it has largely been replaced by newer protocols such as DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which provides more flexibility and functionality in assigning IP addresses dynamically.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on RARP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the main purpose of RARP?\n\n> To assign IP addresses to devices that do not have storage or configuration files to save their IP addresses.\n\n### What layer is the RARP on?\n\n> Network Access layer.\n\n### Is the size of RARP packet fixed?\n\n> No the size of RARP packet is not fixed.\n\n### What is ARP poisoning/spoofing?\n\n> [ARP spoofing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-arp-spoofing-attack/) is a type of network attack in which the attacker sends the falsified ARP request over the LAN (say to the default gateway), which results connecting attacker\u2019s MAC address to the legitimate server on that victim network.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-aws-deepracer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is AWS Deepracer?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-aws-deepracer/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/preetikagupta8171/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[preetikagupta8171](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/preetikagupta8171/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n14\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is RARP?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is a networking protocol that is used to map a physical (MAC) address to an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

Instead of manually configuring each device with an IP address, DHCP allows devices to connect to a network and receive all necessary network information, like IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses, automatically from a DHCP server.\n\nThis makes it easier to manage and maintain large networks, ensuring devices can communicate effectively without conflicts in their network settings. DHCP plays a crucial role in modern networks by simplifying the process of connecting devices and managing network resources efficiently.\n\n## What is DHCP?\n\nDHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is the critical feature on which the users of an enterprise network communicate. DHCP helps enterprises to smoothly manage the allocation of [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) to the end-user clients\u2019 devices such as desktops, laptops, cellphones, etc. is an application layer protocol that is used to provide:\n\n```\nSubnet Mask (Option 1 - e.g., 255.255.255.0)\nRouter Address (Option 3 - e.g., 192.168.1.1)\nDNS Address (Option 6 - e.g., 8.8.8.8)\nVendor Class Identifier (Option 43 - e.g.,\n'unifi' = 192.168.1.9 ##where unifi = controller)\n```\n\nDHCP is based on a [client-server model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/) and based on discovery, offer, request, and ACK.\n\n## Why Do We Use DHCP?\n\nDHCP helps in managing the entire process automatically and centrally. DHCP helps in maintaining a unique IP Address for a host using the server. DHCP servers maintain information on TCP/IP configuration and provide configuration of address to DHCP-enabled clients in the form of a lease offer.\n\n## Components of DHCP\n\nThe main components of DHCP include:\n\n- **DHCP Server:** DHCP Server is a server that holds IP Addresses and other information related to configuration.\n- **DHCP Client:** It is a device that receives configuration information from the server. It can be a mobile, laptop, computer, or any other electronic device that requires a connection.\n- **DHCP Relay:** DHCP relays basically work as a communication channel between DHCP Client and Server.\n- **IP Address Pool:** It is the pool or container of IP Addresses possessed by the DHCP Server. It has a range of addresses that can be allocated to devices.\n- **Subnets:** Subnets are smaller portions of the IP network partitioned to keep networks under control.\n- **Lease:** It is simply the time that how long the information received from the server is valid, in case of expiration of the lease, the tenant must have to re-assign the lease.\n- **DNS Servers:** DHCP servers can also provide [DNS (Domain Name System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) server information to DHCP clients, allowing them to resolve domain names to IP addresses.\n- **Default Gateway:** DHCP servers can also provide information about the default gateway, which is the device that packets are sent to when the destination is outside the local network.\n- **Options:** DHCP servers can provide additional configuration options to clients, such as the subnet mask, domain name, and time server information.\n- **Renewal:** DHCP clients can request to renew their lease before it expires to ensure that they continue to have a valid IP address and configuration information.\n- **Failover:** DHCP servers can be configured for failover, where two servers work together to provide redundancy and ensure that clients can always obtain an IP address and configuration information, even if one server goes down.\n- **Dynamic Updates:** DHCP servers can also be configured to dynamically update DNS records with the IP address of DHCP clients, allowing for easier management of network resources.\n- **Audit Logging:** DHCP servers can keep audit logs of all DHCP transactions, providing administrators with visibility into which devices are using which IP addresses and when leases are being assigned or renewed.\n\n## DHCP Packet Format\n\n![DHCP Packet Format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240627153350/Screenshot-2024-06-27-153322.png)\n\nDHCP Packet Format\n\n- **Hardware Length:** This is an 8-bit field defining the length of the physical address in bytes. e.g for [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/) the value is 6.\n- **Hop count:** This is an 8-bit field defining the maximum number of hops the packet can travel.\n- **Transaction ID:** This is a 4-byte field carrying an integer. The transcation identification is \u00a0set by the client and is used to match a reply with the request. The server returns the same value in its reply.\n- **Number of Seconds:** This is a 16-bit field that indicates the number of seconds elapsed since the time the client started to boot.\n- **Flag:** This is a 16-bit field in which only the leftmost bit is used and the rest of the bit should be set to os. A leftmost bit specifies a forced broadcast reply from the server. If the reply were to be unicast to the client, the destination. IP address of the IP packet is the address assigned to the client.\n- **Client IP Address:** This is a 4-byte field that contains the client IP address . If the client does not have this information this field has a value of 0.\n- **Your IP Address:** This is a 4-byte field that contains the client IP address. It is filled by the server at the request of the client.\n- **Server IP Address:** This is a 4-byte field containing the server IP address. It is filled by the server in a reply message.\n- **Gateway IP Address:** This is a 4-byte field containing the IP address of a routers. IT is filled by the server in a reply message.\n- **Client Hardware Address:** This is the [physical address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) of the client .Although the server can retrieve this address from the frame sent by the client it is more efficient if the address is supplied explicity by the client in the request message.\n- **Server Name:** This is a 64-byte field that is optionally filled by the server in a reply packet. It contains a null-terminated string consisting of the domain name of the server. If the server does not want to fill this filed with data, the server must fill it with all 0s.\n- **Boot Filename:** This is a 128-byte field that can be optionally filled by the server in a reply packet. It contains a null- terminated string consisting of the full pathname of the boot file. The client can use this path to retrieve other booting information. If the server does not want to fill this field with data, the server must fill it with all 0s.\n- **Options:** This is a 64-byte field with a dual purpose. IT can carry either additional information or some specific vendor information. The field is used only in a reply message. The server uses a number, called a magic cookie, in the format of an IP address with the value of 99.130.83.99. When the client finishes reading the message, it looks for this magic cookie. If present the next 60 bytes are options.\n\n## Working of DHCP\n\nDHCP works on the Application layer of the **UDP Protocol**. The main task of DHCP is to dynamically assigns IP Addresses to the Clients and allocate information on TCP/IP configuration to Clients. For more, you can refer to the Article [Working of DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-of-dynamic-host-configuration-protocol/).\n\nThe DHCP **port number** for the server is 67 and for the client is 68. It is a client-server protocol that uses [UDP services](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/). An IP address is assigned from a pool of addresses. In DHCP, the client and the server exchange mainly 4 DHCP messages in order to make a connection, also called the [DORA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-dora-works/) process, but there are 8 DHCP messages in the process.\n\n![Working of DHCP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200714152309/DHCPworking.png)\n\nWorking of DHCP\n\n## The 8 DHCP Messages\n\n**1\\. DHCP Discover Message:** This is the first message generated in the communication process between the server and the client. This message is generated by the Client host in order to discover if there is any DHCP server/servers are present in a network or not. This message is broadcasted to all devices present in a network to find the DHCP server. This message is 342 or 576 bytes long.\n\n![discover](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240731004509/discover.png)\n\nDHCP Discover Message\n\nAs shown in the figure, the source [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/)(client PC) is 08002B2EAF2A, the destination MAC address(server) is FFFFFFFFFFFF, the source IP address is 0.0.0.0(because the PC has had no IP address till now) and the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 (IP address used for broadcasting). As they discover message is broadcast to find out the DHCP server or servers in the network therefore broadcast IP address and MAC address is used.\n\n**2\\. DHCP Offers A Message:** The server will respond to the host in this message specifying the unleased IP address and other TCP configuration information. This message is broadcasted by the server. The size of the message is 342 bytes. If there is more than one DHCP server present in the network then the client host will accept the first DHCP OFFER message it receives. Also, a server ID is specified in the packet in order to identify the server.\n\n![offer-1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240731004707/offer-1.png)\n\nDHCP Offer Message\n\nNow, for the offer message, the source IP address is 172.16.32.12 (server\u2019s IP address in the example), the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 (broadcast IP address), the source MAC address is 00AA00123456, the destination MAC address is 00:11:22:33:44:55 (client\u2019s MAC address). Here, the offer message is broadcast by the DHCP server therefore destination IP address is the broadcast IP address and destination MAC address is 00:11:22:33:44:55 (client\u2019s MAC address)and the source IP address is the server IP address and the MAC address is the server MAC address.\n\nAlso, the server has provided the offered IP address 192.16.32.51 and a lease time of 72 hours(after this time the entry of the host will be erased from the server automatically). Also, the client identifier is the PC MAC address (08002B2EAF2A) for all the messages.\n\n**3\\. DHCP Request Message:** When a client receives an offer message, it responds by broadcasting a DHCP request message. The client will produce a \u00a0gratuitous ARP in order to find if there is any other host present in the network with the same IP address. If there is no reply from another host, then there is no host with the same TCP configuration in the network and the message is broadcasted to the server showing the acceptance of the IP address. A Client ID is also added to this message.\n\n![request-1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240731004829/request-1.png)\n\nDHCP Request Message\n\nNow, the request message is broadcast by the client PC therefore source IP address is 0.0.0.0(as the client has no IP right now) and destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 (the broadcast IP address) and the source MAC address is 08002B2EAF2A (PC MAC address) and destination MAC address is FFFFFFFFFFFF.\n\n**Note \u2013** This message is broadcast after the ARP request broadcast by the PC to find out whether any other host is not using that offered IP. If there is no reply, then the client host broadcast the DHCP request message for the server showing the acceptance of the IP address and Other TCP/IP Configuration.\n\n**4\\. DHCP Acknowledgment Message:** In response to the request message received, the server will make an entry with a specified client ID and bind the IP address offered with lease time. Now, the client will have the IP address provided by the server.\n\n![acknowledgement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240731004359/acknowledgement.png)\n\nNow the server will make an entry of the client host with the offered IP address and lease time. This IP address will not be provided by the server to any other host. The destination MAC address is 00:11:22:33:44:55 (client\u2019s MAC address) and the destination IP address is 255.255.255.255 and the source IP address is 172.16.32.12 and the source [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) is 00AA00123456 (server MAC address).\n\n**5\\. DHCP Negative Acknowledgment Message:** Whenever a DHCP server receives a request for an IP address that is invalid according to the scopes that are configured, it sends a DHCP Nak message to the client. Eg-when the server has no IP address unused or the pool is empty, then this message is sent by the server to the client.\n\n**6\\. DHCP Decline:** If the DHCP client determines the offered configuration parameters are different or invalid, it sends a DHCP decline message to the server. When there is a reply to the gratuitous [ARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/) by any host to the client, the client sends a DHCP decline message to the server showing the offered IP address is already in use.\n\n**7\\. DHCP Release:** A DHCP client sends a DHCP release packet to the server to release the IP address and cancel any remaining lease time.\n\n**8\\. DHCP Inform:** If a client address has obtained an IP address manually then the client uses DHCP information to obtain other local configuration parameters, such as domain name. In reply to the DHCP inform message, the DHCP server generates a DHCP ack message with a local configuration suitable for the client without allocating a new IP address. This DHCP ack message is unicast to the client.\n\n**Note \u2013** All the messages can be unicast also by the DHCP relay agent if the server is present in a different network.\n\n## Security Considerations for Using DHCP\n\nTo make sure your DHCP servers are safe, consider these DHCP security issues:\n\n- **Limited IP Addresses** : A DHCP server can only offer a set number of IP addresses. This means attackers could flood the server with requests, causing essential devices to lose their connection.\n- **Fake DHCP Servers** : Attackers might set up fake DHCP servers to give out fake IP addresses to devices on your network.\n- **DNS Access** : When users get an IP address from DHCP, they also get DNS server details. This could potentially allow them to access more data than they should. It\u2019s important to restrict network access, use firewalls, and secure connections with VPNs to protect against this.\n\n## Protection Against DHCP Starvation Attack\n\nA [DHCP starvation attack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-starvation-attack/) happens when a hacker floods a DHCP server with requests for IP addresses. This overwhelms the server, making it unable to assign addresses to legitimate users. The hacker can then block access for authorized users and potentially set up a fake DHCP server to intercept and manipulate network traffic, which could lead to a [man-in-the-middle attack.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attack/)\n\n## Reasons Why Enterprises Must Automate DHCP?\n\nAutomating your DHCP system is crucial for businesses because it reduces the time and effort your IT team spends on manual tasks. For instance, DHCP-related issues like printers not connecting or subnets not working with the main network can be avoided automatically.\n\nAutomated DHCP also allows your operations to grow smoothly. Instead of hiring more staff to handle tasks that automation can manage, your team can focus on other important areas of business growth.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- Centralized management of IP addresses.\n- Centralized and automated [TCP/IP configuration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/) .\n- Ease of adding new clients to a network.\n- Reuse of IP addresses reduces the total number of IP addresses that are required.\n- The efficient handling of IP address changes for clients that must be updated frequently, such as those for portable devices that move to different locations on a wireless network.\n- Simple reconfiguration of the IP address space on the DHCP server without needing to reconfigure each client.\n- The DHCP protocol gives the network administrator a method to configure the network from a centralized area.\n- With the help of DHCP, easy handling of new users and the reuse of IP addresses can be achieved.\n\n## **Disadvantages**\n\n- IP conflict can occur.\n- The problem with DHCP is that clients accept any server. Accordingly, when another server is in the vicinity, the client may connect with this server, and this server may possibly send invalid data to the client.\n- The client is not able to access the network in absence of a DHCP Server.\n- The name of the machine will not be changed in a case when a new IP Address is assigned.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, DHCP is a technology that simplifies network setup by automatically assigning [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) and network configurations to devices. While DHCP offers convenience, it\u2019s important to manage its security carefully. Issues such as IP address exhaustion, and potential data access through [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) settings highlight the need for robust security measures like firewalls and [VPNs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vpn-and-how-it-works/) to protect networks from unauthorized access and disruptions. DHCP remains essential for efficiently managing network connections while ensuring security against potential risks.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on DHCP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What are common issues with DHCP?\n\n> If the DHCP server is not properly set, it can cause difficulties such as IP address conflicts, incorrect subnet masks, incorrect default gateways, or insufficient IP address pools.\n\n### Which port is used in DHCP?\n\n> DHCP uses UDP port 67 on the server and UDP port 68 on the client.\n\n### Which layer protocol is DHCP?\n\n> DHCP is an application layer protocol.\n\n### Why is DHCP preferred?\n\n> It is a more efficient method for managing IP addresses than static address allocation. DHCP employs a stable transport layer protocol.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-starvation-attack/?ref=next_article)\n\n[DHCP Starvation Attack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dhcp-starvation-attack/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Ethical Hacking Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis Ethical Hacking tutorial covers both basic and advanced concepts of Ethical Hacking.

The protocol is at the network layer. It is mostly utilized on network equipment like routers and is utilized for error handling at the network layer. Since there are various kinds of network layer faults, ICMP can be utilized to report and troubleshoot these errors.\n\nSince IP does not have an inbuilt mechanism for sending error and control messages. It depends on Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to provide [error control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-control-in-data-link-layer/).\u00a0In this article, we are going to discuss ICMP in detail along with their uses, messages, etc.\n\n## What is ICMP?\n\nICMP is used for reporting errors and management queries. It is a supporting protocol and is used by network devices like routers for sending error messages and operations information. For example, the requested service is not available or a host or [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) could not be reached.\n\nSince the IP protocol lacks an error-reporting or [error-correcting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-correction-in-computer-networks/) mechanism, information is communicated via a message. For instance, when a message is sent to its intended recipient, it may be intercepted along the route from the sender. The sender may believe that the communication has reached its destination if no one reports the problem. If a middleman reports the mistake, ICMP helps in notifying the sender about the issue. For example, if a message can\u2019t reach its destination, if there\u2019s network congestion, or if packets are lost, ICMP sends back feedback about these issues. This feedback is essential for diagnosing and fixing network problems, making sure that communication can be adjusted or rerouted to keep everything running smoothly.\n\n## Uses of ICMP\n\nICMP is used for error reporting if two devices connect over the internet and some error occurs, So, the router sends an ICMP error message to the source informing about the error. For Example, whenever a device sends any message which is large enough for the receiver, in that case, the receiver will drop the message and reply to the ICMP message to the source.\n\nAnother important use of ICMP protocol is used to perform network diagnosis by making use of traceroute and ping utility.\n\n**Traceroute:** [Traceroute](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/traceroute-in-network-layer/) utility is used to know the route between two devices connected over the internet. It routes the journey from one router to another, and a traceroute is performed to check network issues before data transfer.\n\n**Ping:** [Ping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ping/) is a simple kind of traceroute known as the echo-request message, it is used to measure the time taken by data to reach the destination and return to the source, these replies are known as echo-replies messages.\n\n## How Does ICMP Work?\n\nICMP is the primary and important protocol of the IP suite, but ICMP isn\u2019t associated with any transport layer protocol [(TCP or UDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/) as it doesn\u2019t need to establish a connection with the destination device before sending any message as it is a connectionless protocol.\n\nThe working of ICMP is just contrasting with TCP, as TCP is a connection-oriented protocol whereas ICMP is a connectionless protocol. Whenever a connection is established before the message sending, both devices must be ready through a [TCP Handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/).\n\nICMP packets are transmitted in the form of datagrams that contain an IP header with ICMP data. ICMP datagram is similar to a packet, which is an independent data entity.\n\n## ICMP Packet Format\n\nICMP header comes after IPv4 and IPv6 packet header.\n\n![ICMPv4 Packet Format](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211107223027/gfg.png)\n\nICMPv4 Packet Format\n\nIn the ICMP packet format, the first 32 bits of the packet contain three fields:\n\n**Type (8-bit):** The initial 8-bit of the packet is for message type, it provides a brief description of the message so that receiving network would know what kind of message it is receiving and how to respond to it. Some common message types are as follows:\n\n- Type 0 \u2013 Echo reply\n- Type 3 \u2013 Destination unreachable\n- Type 5 \u2013 Redirect Message\n- Type 8 \u2013 Echo Request\n- Type 11 \u2013 Time Exceeded\n- Type 12 \u2013 Parameter problem\n\n**Code (8-bit):** Code is the next 8 bits of the ICMP packet format, this field carries some additional information about the error message and type.\n\n**Checksum (16-bit):** Last 16 bits are for the checksum field in the ICMP packet header. The [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) is used to check the number of bits of the complete message and enable the ICMP tool to ensure that complete data is delivered.\n\nThe next 32 bits of the ICMP Header are Extended Header which has the work of pointing out the problem in IP Message. Byte locations are identified by the pointer which causes the problem message and receiving device looks here for pointing to the problem.\n\nThe last part of the ICMP packet is Data or Payload of variable length. The bytes included in IPv4 are 576 bytes and in IPv6, 1280 bytes.\n\n## ICMP in DDoS Attacks\n\nIn [Distributed DOS (DDoS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ddosdistributed-denial-of-service/) attacks, attackers provide so much extra traffic to the target, so that it cannot provide service to users. There are so many ways through which an attacker executes these attacks, which are described below.\n\n### Ping of Death Attack\n\nWhenever an attacker sends a ping, whose size is greater than the maximum allowable size, oversized packets are broken into smaller parts. When the sender re-assembles it, the size exceeds the limit which causes a [buffer overflow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buffer-overflow-attack-with-example/) and makes the machine freeze. This is simply called a [Ping of Death Attack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ping-flood-attack/). Newer devices have protection from this attack, but older devices did not have protection from this attack.\n\n### ICMP Flood Attack\n\nWhenever the sender sends so many pings that the device on whom the target is done is unable to handle the echo request. This type of attack is called an [ICMP Flood Attack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/icmp-flood-ddos-attack/). This attack is also called a ping flood attack. It stops the target computer\u2019s resources and causes a denial of service for the target computer.\n\n### Smurf Attack\n\nSmurf Attack is a type of attack in which the attacker sends an ICMP packet with a spoofed source IP address. These type of attacks generally works on older devices like the ping of death attack.\n\n## Types of ICMP Messages\n\n| Type | Code | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 \u2013 Echo Reply | 0 | Echo reply |\n| 3 \u2013 Destination Unreachable | 0 | Destination network unreachable |\n| 1 | Destination host unreachable |\n| 2 | Destination protocol unreachable |\n| 3 | Destination port unreachable |\n| 4 | Fragmentation is needed and the DF flag set |\n| 5 | Source route failed |\n| 5 \u2013 Redirect Message | 0 | Redirect the datagram for the network |\n| 1 | Redirect datagram for the host |\n| 2 | Redirect the datagram for the Type of Service and Network |\n| 3 | Redirect datagram for the Service and Host |\n| 8 \u2013 Echo Request | 0 | Echo request |\n| 9 \u2013 Router Advertisement | 0 | Use to discover the addresses of operational routers |\n| 10 \u2013 Router Solicitation | 0 |\n| 11 \u2013 Time Exceeded | 0 | Time to live exceeded in transit |\n| 1 | Fragment reassembly time exceeded. |\n| 12 \u2013 Parameter Problem | 0 | The pointer indicates an error. |\n| 1 | Missing required option |\n| 2 | Bad length |\n| 13 \u2013 Timestamp | 0 | Used for time synchronization |\n| 14 \u2013 Timestamp Reply | 0 | Reply to Timestamp message |\n\n### **Source Quench Message**\n\nA source quench message is a request to decrease the traffic rate for messages sent to the host destination) or we can say when receiving host detects that the rate of sending packets (traffic rate) to it is too fast it sends the source quench message to the source to slow the pace down so that no packet can be lost.\n\n![Source Quench Message](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1-73.png)\n\nSource Quench Message\n\nICMP will take the source IP from the discarded packet and inform the source by sending a source quench message.\u00a0The source will reduce the speed of transmission so that router will be free from congestion.\n\n![Source Quench Message with Reduced Speed](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2-46.png)\n\nSource Quench Message with Reduced Speed\n\nWhen the congestion router is far away from the source the ICMP will send a hop-by-hop source quench message so that every router will reduce the speed of transmission.\n\n### **Parameter Problem**\n\nWhenever packets come to the router then the calculated header checksum should be equal to the received header checksum then only the packet is accepted by the router.\n\n![Parameter Problem](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/3-53.png)\n\nParameter Problem\n\nIf there is a mismatch packet will be dropped by the router.\n\nICMP will take the source IP from the discarded packet and inform the source by sending a parameter problem message.\n\n### **Time Exceeded Message**\n\n![Time Exceeded Message](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/4-30.png)\n\nTime Exceeded Message\n\nA notification with the subject line \u201cTime Exceeded\u201d is typically generated by routers or gateways. You need to know what an IP header is in a packet in order to comprehend this ICMP message in its entirety. The IP protocol structure is covered in great detail in the section on IP Protocol, which is freely available to our readers.\n\n### **Destination Un-reachable**\n\nThe destination is unreachable and is generated by the host or its inbound gateway to inform the client that the destination is unreachable for some reason.\n\n![Destination Un-reachable](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/5-21.png)\n\nDestination Un-reachable\n\nThere is no necessary condition that only the router gives the ICMP error message time the destination host sends an ICMP error message when any type of failure (link failure, hardware failure, port failure, etc) happens in the network.\n\n### **Redirection Message**\n\nRedirect requests data packets are sent on an alternate route. The message informs a host to update its routing information (to send packets on an alternate route).\n\n**Example:** If the host tries to send data through a router R1 and R1 sends data on a router R2 and there is a direct way from the host to R2. Then R1 will send a redirect message to inform the host that there is the best way to the destination directly through R2 available. The host then sends data packets for the destination directly to R2.\n\nThe router R2 will send the original datagram to the intended destination.\n\nBut if the datagram contains routing information then this message will not be sent even if a better route is available as redirects should only be sent by gateways and should not be sent by Internet hosts.\n\n![Redirection Message](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/6-18.png)\n\nRedirection Message\n\nWhenever a packet is forwarded in the wrong direction later it is re-directed in a current direction then ICMP will send a re-directed message.\n\nFor more, you can refer to [Types of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Messages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-icmp-internet-control-message-protocol-messages/).\n\n## Advantages of ICMP\n\n- Network devices use ICMP to send error messages, and administrators can use the Ping and Tracert commands to debug the network.\n- These alerts are used by administrators to identify issues with network connectivity.\n- A prime example is when a destination or gateway host notifies the source host via an ICMP message if there is a problem or a change in network connectivity that needs to be reported. Examples include when a destination host or networking becomes unavailable, when a packet is lost during transmission, etc.\n- Furthermore, network performance and connection monitoring tools commonly employ ICMP to identify the existence of issues that the network team has to resolve.\n- One quick and simple method to test connections and find the source is to use the ICMP protocol, which consists of queries and answers.\n\n## Disadvantages of ICMP\n\n- If the router drops a packet, it may be due to an error; but, because to the way the IP (internet protocol) is designed, there is no way for the sender to be notified of this problem.\n- Assume, while a data packet is being transmitted over the internet, that its lifetime is over and that the value of the time to live field has dropped to zero. In this case, the data packet is destroyed.\n- Although devices frequently need to interact with one another, there isn\u2019t a standard method for them to do so in Internet Protocol. For instance, the host needs to verify the destination\u2019s vital signs to see if it is still operational before transmitting data.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on ICMP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is ICMP used for?**\n\n> Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for error reporting. Error Reporting by ICMP works by sending messages to the sender from the receiver in the case when data is not received.\n\n### **Is ICMP the same as ping?**\n\n> ICMP and ping are two different things, but they are somehow related. ICMP is a protocol that manages the messages between the devices and Ping is produced using ICMP.\n\n### **How does ICMP ping work?**\n\n> ICMP ping is a way to check whether there is a connection established between two devices on the internet. We can check packet loss or any delay that happens within the network with the help of ICMP ping.\n\n### What is the role of ICMP in IPv6?\n\n> ICMPv6 is utilized in IPv6 for more than only fault reporting and signaling, it is used for: Neighbor Discovery, which functions similarly to ARP in IPv4. Multicast address management and host configuration are handled by the Router Discovery function.\n\n### ICMP is operate at which layer?\n\n> ICMP is operated at Network Layer of the OSI Model.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\nNetwork Layer Protocol-ICMP in Computer Network\n\n[Visit Course![explore course icon](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Vector11.svg)](https://gfgcdn.com/tu/U4D/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ping/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Ping?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ping/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n97\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

IGMP is a communication protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers for multicasting communication with IP networks and uses the resources efficiently to transmit the message/data packets. Multicast communication can have single or multiple senders and receivers and thus, IGMP can be used in streaming videos, gaming, or web conferencing tools. This protocol is used on IPv4 networks and for using this on IPv6, multicasting is managed by Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD).\n\nLike other network protocols, IGMP is used on the network layer. MLDv1 is almost the same in functioning as IGMPv2 and MLDv2 is almost similar to IGMPv3. The communication protocol, IGMPv1 was developed in 1989 at Stanford University. IGMPv1 was updated to IGMPv2 in the year 1997 and again updated to IGMPv3 in the year 2002.\u00a0The IGMP protocol is used by the hosts and router to identify the hosts in a LAN that are the members of a group. IGMP is a part of the IP layer and IGMP has a fixed-size message. The IGMP message is encapsulated within an IP datagram.\n\nThe IP protocol supports two types of communication:\n\n- Unicasting- It is a communication between one sender and one receiver. Therefore, we can say that it is one-to-one communication.\n- Multicasting: Sometimes the sender wants to send the same message to a large of receivers simultaneously. This process is known as multicasting which has one-to-many communication.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Streaming \u2013** Multicast routing protocols are used for audio and video streaming over the network i.e., either one-to-many or many-to-many.\n- **Gaming \u2013** Internet group management protocol is often used in simulation games which has multiple users over the network such as online games.\n- **Web Conferencing tools \u2013** Video conferencing is a new method to meet people from your own convenience and IGMP connects to the users for conferencing and transfers the message/data packets efficiently.\n\n## What Types of IGMP Messages Are There?\n\nThe IGMP uses several types of messages to manage multicast group memberships:\n\n- IGMP Membership Query: The Sent by routers to determine which multicast groups have members on a particular network segment. This query helps routers maintain accurate multicast group membership information.\n- IGMP Membership Report: Sent by hosts to indicate their interest in joining a multicast group. This report informs the router of the presence of a host that wants to receive multicast traffic.\n- IGMP Leave Group: Sent by hosts to indicate that they are leaving a multicast group. This message informs the router that the host no longer wants to receive traffic for that group.\n- IGMP V3 Membership Report (in IGMPv3): This allows hosts to specify the exact multicast group addresses they want to join or leave and can include source-specific multicast (SSM) information.\n\n## **Working of IGMP**\n\nIGMP works on devices that are capable of handling multicast groups and dynamic multicasting. These devices allow the host to join or leave the membership in the multicast group. These devices also allow to add and remove clients from the group. This communication protocol is operated between the host and the local multicast router. When a multicast group is created, the multicast group address is in the range of class D (224-239) [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) and is forwarded as the destination IP address in the packet. ![IGMP Working](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429202814/IGMP-working-gfg.png)\u00a0L2 or Level-2 devices such as switches are used in between host and multicast router for IGMP snooping. IGMP snooping is a process to listen to the IGMP network traffic in controlled manner. Switch receives the message from host and forwards the membership report to the local multicast router. The multicast traffic is further forwarded to remote routers from local multicast routers using PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast) so that clients can receive the message/data packets. Clients wishing to join the network sends join message in the query and switch intercepts the message and adds the ports of clients to its multicast routing table.\n\n## What is IGMP Snooping?\n\nThe IGMP snooping is a network switch feature that allows switches to listen to the IGMP messages exchanged between the hosts and routers. By \u201csnooping\u201d on these messages the switch can maintain a mapping of which ports are associated with the specific multicast groups. This mapping enables the switch to efficiently forward multicast traffic only to the ports that have subscribed members reducing unnecessary broadcast traffic and improving network performance.\n\n## How is Multicasting Different from Anycast and Unicast?\n\n- Multicast: A method where data is sent from one sender to multiple specific recipients using the multicast address. It allows efficient data distribution to the group of users.\n- Anycast: A method where data is sent to the nearest member of a group of potential recipients. It is used to route data to the closest server or service instance based on the network distance.\n- Unicast: A method where data is sent from one sender to one specific recipient. Each communication session is established between a single sender and a single receiver.\n\n## Is IGMP a Layer 3 Protocol?\n\nYes, IGMP operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model which is the Network layer. It is used to the manage the membership of the multicast groups within IP networks facilitating the efficient distribution of the multicast traffic across the network segments.\n\n**Types:** There are 3 versions of IGMP. These versions are backward compatible. Following are the versions of IGMP: **1\\. IGMPv1 :** The version of IGMP communication protocol allows all the supporting hosts to join the multicast groups using membership request and include some basic features. But, host cannot leave the group on their own and have to wait for a timeout to leave the group. The message packet format in IGMPv1:\n\n![IGMP Packet Format - Version 1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429052624/IGMPv1-gfg.png)\n\n- **Version \u2013** Set to 1.\n- **Type \u2013** 1 for Host Membership Query and Host Membership Report.\n- **Unused \u2013** 8-bits of zero which are of no use.\n- **Checksum \u2013** It is the one\u2019s complement of the sum of IGMP messages.\n- **Group Address \u2013** The group address field is zero when sent and ignored when received in membership query message. In a membership report message, the group address field takes the IP host group address of the group being reported.\n\n**2\\. IGMPv2 :** IGMPv2 is the revised version of IGMPv1 communication protocol. It has added functionality of leaving the multicast group using group membership. The message packet format in IGMPv2:\n\n![IGMP Packet Format - Version 2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429062558/IGMPv2-gfg.png)**Type:**\n\n```\n0x11 for Membership Query\n0x12 for IGMPv1 Membership Report\n0x16 for IGMPv2 Membership Report\n0x22 for IGMPv3 Membership Report\n0x17 for Leave Group\n```\n\n- **Max Response Time \u2013** This field is ignored for message types other than membership query. For membership query type, it is the maximum time allowed before sending a response report. The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.\n- **Checksum \u2013** It is the one\u2019s complement of the sum of IGMP message. It determines the entire payload of the IP datagram in which IGMP message is encapsulated.\n- **Group Address \u2013** It is set as 0 when sending a general query. Otherwise, multicast address for group-specific or source-specific queries. The behavior of this field depends on the type of the message sent.\n\nFor Membership Query, the group address is set to zero for General Query and set to multicast group address for a specific query. For Membership Report, the group address is set to the multicast group address is set to the multicast group address. For Leave Group, it is set to the multicast group address.\n\n**3\\. IGMPv3 :** IGMPv2 was revised to IGMPv3 and added source-specific multicast and membership report aggregation. These reports are sent to 224.0.0.22. The message packet format in IGMPv3:\n\n![IGMP Packet Format - Version 3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200429074150/IGMPv3-gfg.png)\n\n- **Max Response Time \u2013** This field is ignored for message types other than membership query. For membership query type, it is the maximum time allowed before sending a response report. The value is in units of 0.1 seconds.\n- **Checksum \u2013** It is the one\u2019s complement of the one\u2019s complement of the sum of IGMP message.\n- **Group Address \u2013** It is set as 0 when sending a general query. Otherwise, multicast address for group-specific or source-specific queries.\n- **Resv \u2013** It is set zero of sent and ignored when received.\n- **S flag \u2013** It represents Suppress Router-side Processing flag. When the flag is set, it indicates to suppress the timer updates that multicast routers perform upon receiving any query.\n- **QRV \u2013** It represents Querier\u2019s Robustness Variable. Routers keeps on retrieving the QRV value from the most recently received query as their own value until the most recently received QRV is zero.\n- **QQIC \u2013** It represents Querier\u2019s Query Interval Code.\n- **Number of sources \u2013** It represents the number of source addresses present in the query. For general query or group-specific query, this field is zero and for group-and-source-specific query, this field is non-zero.\n- **Source Address\\[i\\] \u2013** It represents the IP unicast address for N fields.\n\n## What is Multicasting?\n\nMulticasting is a method of sending network packets to a specific group of recipients simultaneously, rather than broadcasting to all devices on the network or sending individual copies to each recipient. It is an efficient way to distribute data such as streaming media or real-time updates to multiple users without the duplicating the data stream for each recipient. In multicasting, the sender transmits the data only once and network devices use multicast addressing to forward the packets to the subscribed group members.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- IGMP communication protocol efficiently transmits the multicast data to the receivers and so, no junk packets are transmitted to the host which shows optimized performance.\n- Bandwidth is consumed totally as all the shared links are connected.\n- Hosts can leave a multicast group and join another.\n\n## **Disadvantages**\n\n- It does not provide good efficiency in filtering and security.\n- Due to lack of TCP, network congestion can occur.\n- IGMP is vulnerable to some attacks such as [DOS attack (Denial-Of-Service)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-dos-attacks/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe IGMP is a critical protocol for managing multicast group memberships and enabling the efficient multicast communication in IP networks. By understanding IGMP, multicasting and related concepts network professionals can optimize data distribution, reduce network traffic and ensure effective multicast service delivery. The IGMP, through its various message types and features like IGMP snooping plays a significant role in the maintaining network performance and scalability in the environments that use multicast communications.\n\n## What is IGMP(Internet Group Management Protocol)? \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Why is IGMP Necessary?\n\n> IGMP is necessary to manage multicast group memberships in an IP network. It allows routers to determine which hosts belong to specific multicast groups and ensures that multicast traffic is only sent to those hosts interested in receiving it. This helps reduce network congestion.\n\n### How Does IGMP Work?\n\n> IGMP works by enabling hosts to send messages to routers indicating their interest in joining or leaving specific multicast groups. Routers use this information to forward multicast traffic only to the hosts that have joined a particular group.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-responsibilities/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Transport Layer responsibilities](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-responsibilities/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/1uydkvglu7hftcu3g339)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/utkarsh_kumar/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[utkarsh\\_kumar](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/utkarsh_kumar/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n11\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Full Form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/full-form/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

In this article, we will discuss Routing Information Protocol in detail.\n\n## What is Routing Information Protocol?\n\nThe Routing Information Protocol is a distance vector routing protocol that helps routers determine the best path to transfer data packets across the network. RIP works on the Network layer of the [OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/). It uses **hop count** as its metric for determining the best path, but the maximum hop count allowed in the RIP is 15. Routing Information Protocol is mostly used in small to medium-sized networks.\n\n### **What is Hop Count?**\n\nHop count is the number of routers occurring between the source and destination network. The path with the lowest hop count is considered the best route to reach a network and therefore placed in the routing table. RIP prevents routing loops by limiting the hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The maximum hop count allowed for RIP is 15 and a hop count of 16 is considered as network unreachable.\n\n## **Features of RIP**\n\n- Updates of the network are exchanged periodically.\n- Updates (routing information) are always broadcast.\n- Full routing tables are sent in updates.\n- Routers always trust routing information received from neighbor routers. This is also known as Routingonrumors.\n\n## How Routing Information Protocol Works?\n\nRouting Information Protocol uses [Distance Vector Routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/distance-vector-routing-dvr-protocol/) to put the packets to its destination. In RIP, Each router maintains a routing table where the distance to each destination is mentioned. RIP sharesits [routing tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) to neighbouring routers at an interval of 30 seconds through [broadcasting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-broadcasting-in-computer-network/). Upon receiving the data, each router updates the table according to that. If an router receives a route and it is shorter than the previous one, then router simply updates the data in the table.\n\nRIP has a limit of 15 hops, that is, if some route requires more than 15 hops, then that path in unreachable. It helps in limiting the size of network that a router can handle. In case, if a route is not updated in six successful cycles ( 180 seconds) in the routing table, the RIP will drop that route and inform rest of the network about the same.\n\nRouting Information Protocol is simple to implement, but it is more efficient for smaller networks, for larger networks, protocols like [OSPF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-states/) or [EIGRP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eigrp-fundamentals/) are preferred.\n\n## **Difference Between RIP Versions**\n\nThere are three versions of routing information protocol. These are mentioned below:\n\n- RIP Version1 (RIP v1)\n- RIP Version2 (RIP v2)\n- RIPng\n\nLet\u2019s look into the differences between them through the table:\n\n| RIP v1 | RIP v2 | RIPng |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sends update as broadcast | Sends update as multicast | Sends update as multicast |\n| Broadcast at 255.255.255.255 | Multicast at 224.0.0.9 | Multicast at FF02::9 (RIPng can only run on IPv6 networks) |\n| Doesn\u2019t support the authentication of updated messages | Supports authentication of RIPv2 update messages | \u2013 |\n| Classful routing protocol | Classless protocol updated supports classful | Classless updates are sent |\n\n**RIP v1** is known as **Classful Routing Protocol** because it doesn\u2019t send information of subnet mask in its routing update.\n\n**RIP v2** is known as **Classless** **Routing Protocol** because it sends information of subnet mask in its routing update.\n\n```\n>> Use debug command to get the details :\n\u00a0     # debug ip rip\n>> Use this command to show all routes configured in router, say for router R1 :\n      R1# show ip route\n>> Use this command to show all protocols configured in router, say for router R1 :\n     \u00a0R1# show ip protocols\n```\n\n## **RIP Configuration**\n\nConsider the given topology which has 3-routers R1, R2, R3. R1 has IP address 172.16.10.6/30 on s0/0/1, 192.168.20.1/24 on fa0/0. R2 has IP address 172.16.10.2/30 on s0/0/0, 192.168.10.1/24 on fa0/0. R3 has IP address 172.16.10.5/30 on s0/1, 172.16.10.1/30 on s0/0, 10.10.10.1/24 on fa0/0\n\n![RIP topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241112154416815903/image.webp)\n\n**Configure RIP for R1**\n\n```\nR1(config)# router rip\nR1(config-router)# network 192.168.20.0\nR1(config-router)# network 172.16.10.4\nR1(config-router)# version 2\nR1(config-router)# no auto-summary\n```\n\n**Note:** no auto-summary command disables the auto-summarisation. If we don\u2019t select any auto-summary, then the subnet mask will be considered as classful in Version 1.\n\n**Configuring RIP for R2**\n\n```\nR2(config)# router rip\nR2(config-router)# network 192.168.10.0\nR2(config-router)# network 172.16.10.0\nR2(config-router)# version 2\nR2(config-router)# no auto-summary\n```\n\n**Similarly, Configure RIP for R3**\n\n```\nR3(config)# router rip\nR3(config-router)# network 10.10.10.0\nR3(config-router)# network 172.16.10.4\nR3(config-router)# network 172.16.10.0\nR3(config-router)# version 2\nR3(config-router)# no auto-summary\n```\n\n## **What are Different Types of RIP Timers?**\n\n- **Update timer:** The default timing for routing information being exchanged by the routers operating RIP is 30 seconds. Using an Update timer, the routers exchange their routing table periodically.\n- **Invalid timer:** If no update comes until 180 seconds, then the destination router considers it invalid. In this scenario, the destination router mark hop counts as 16 for that router.\n- **Hold down timer:** This is the time for which the router waits for a neighbor router to respond. If the router isn\u2019t able to respond within a given time then it is declared dead. It is 180 seconds by default.\n- **Flush time:** It is the time after which the entry of the route will be flushed if it doesn\u2019t respond within the flush time. It is 60 seconds by default. This timer starts after the route has been declared invalid and after 60 seconds i.e time will be 180 + 60 = 240 seconds.\n\nNote that all these times are adjustable. Use this command to change the timers :\n\n```\nR1(config-router)#  timers basic\nR1(config-router)#  timers basic 20   80    80    90\n```\n\n## **Where Routing Information Protocols are Used?**\n\n- **Small to medium-sized networks**: RIP is normally utilized in little to medium-sized networks that have moderately basic directing prerequisites. It is not difficult to design and requires little support, which goes with it a famous decision for little organizations.\n- **Legacy Organizations:** RIP is as yet utilized in some heritage networks that were set up before further developed steering conventions were created. These organizations may not merit the expense and exertion of overhauling, so they keep on involving RIP as their directing convention.\n- **Lab Conditions:** RIP is much of the time utilized in lab conditions for testing and learning purposes. A basic convention is not difficult to set up, which pursues it a decent decision for instructive purposes.\n- **Backup or Repetitive Steering:** In certain organizations, RIP might be utilized as a reinforcement or excess directing convention, on the off chance that the essential steering convention falls flat or encounters issues. RIP isn\u2019t generally so productive as other directing conventions, however, it very well may be helpful as a reinforcement if there should be an occurrence of crisis.\n\n## **Advantages of RIP**\n\n- **Simplicity:** RIP is a relatively simple protocol to configure and manage, making it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized networks with limited resources.\n- **Easy implementation:** RIP is easy to implement, as it does not require much technical expertise to set up and maintain.\n- **Convergence:** RIP is known for its fast convergence time, meaning that it can quickly adapt to changes in network topology and route packets efficiently.\n- **Automatic updates:** RIP automatically updates routing tables at regular intervals, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is being used to route packets.\n- **Low bandwidth overhead:** RIP uses a relatively low amount of bandwidth to exchange routing information, making it an ideal choice for networks with limited bandwidth.\n- **Compatibility:** RIP is compatible with many different types of routers and network devices, making it easy to integrate into existing networks.\n\n## **Disadvantages of RIP**\n\n- **Limited scalability:** RIP has limited scalability, and it may not be the best choice for larger networks with complex topologies. RIP can only support up to 15 hops, which may not be sufficient for larger networks.\n- **Slow convergence:** While RIP is known for its fast convergence time, it can be slower to converge than other routing protocols. This can lead to delays and inefficiencies in network performance.\n- **Routing loops:** RIP can sometimes create routing loops, which can cause network congestion and reduce overall network performance.\n- **Limited support for load balancing:** RIP does not support sophisticated load balancing, which can result in suboptimal routing paths and uneven network traffic distribution.\n- **Security vulnerabilities:** RIP does not provide any native security features, making it vulnerable to attacks such as spoofing and tampering.\n- **Inefficient use of bandwidth:** RIP uses a lot of bandwidth for periodic updates, which can be inefficient in networks with limited bandwidth.\n\n## Limitations of RIP\n\nOn using RIP, there can be certain limitations. Some of them are mentioned below:\n\n- **Increase in Network Traffic:** RIP increases traffic to the neighbouring routers as it regularly performs updates on them.\n- **Limitation of Hop Count**: Since, RIP has a maximum hop count of 15, therefore it is not suitable for large networks.\n- **Difference in Closest Path and Shortest Path:** Since, RIP does not consider all factors while calculating shortest path, therefore, it creates a difference between closest path and shortest path.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count to determine the best paths within a network. It is a simple and easy to implement protocol and that makes it suitable for small to medium-sized networks.\n\nRouting Information protocol has certain limitations, like it has a maximum hop count of 15 that makes it less preferable for larger and more complex networks. For a large-scale networks, more advanced routing protocols like OSPF or EIGRP are preferred.\n\n## Routing Information Protocol (RIP) \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is split horizon in RIP?**\n\n> **Split horizon** is a technique used in RIP to prevent routing loops. It ensures that a router does not advertise a route back to the router from which it was learned.\n\n### **Can RIP handle load balancing?**\n\n> Yes, RIP supports load balancing by allowing multiple routes to the same destination if they have the same hop count. This enables traffic to be distributed across multiple paths.\n\n### **How is RIP configured on a router?**\n\n> RIP is configured through the router\u2019s command-line interface (CLI) by entering specific commands to enable the protocol, specify the networks to be included, and set options like version and authentication.\n\n### **What is route poisoning in RIP?**\n\n> Route poisoning is a method used in RIP to mark a route as unreachable by setting its hop count to 16. This helps inform other routers about a failed route quickly.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configuring-rip-default-information-originate-in-cisco/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Configuring RIP Default Information Originate in Cisco](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configuring-rip-default-information-originate-in-cisco/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Networks-Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/computer-networks-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

OSPF is developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as one of the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), i.e, the protocol which aims at moving the packet within a large autonomous system or routing domain. It is a network layer protocol which works on protocol number 89 and uses AD value 110. OSPF uses multicast address 224.0.0.5 for normal communication and 224.0.0.6 for update to designated router(DR)/Backup Designated Router (BDR).\n\n## **OSPF Terms**\n\n1. **Router Id \u2013** It is the highest active IP address present on the router. First, the highest loopback address is considered. If no loopback is configured then the highest active IP address on the interface of the router is considered.\n2. **Router priority \u2013** It is an 8-bit value assigned to a router operating OSPF, used to elect DR and BDR in a broadcast network.\n3. **Designated Router (DR) \u2013** It is elected to minimize the number of adjacencies formed. DR distributes the LSAs to all the other routers. DR is elected in a broadcast network to which all the other routers share their DBD. In a broadcast network, the router requests for an update to DR, and DR will respond to that request with an update.\n4. **Backup Designated Router (BDR) \u2013** BDR is a backup to DR in a broadcast network. When DR goes down, BDR becomes DR and performs its functions.\n5. **DR and BDR election \u2013** DR and BDR election takes place in the broadcast network or multi-access network. Here are the criteria for the election:\n   - The router having the highest router priority will be declared as DR.\n   - If there is a tie in router priority then the highest router I\u2019d be considered. First, the highest loopback address is considered. If no loopback is configured then the highest active IP address on the interface of the router is considered.\n\nOSPF, one of the most popular routing protocols, operates through various states such as DOWN, INIT, and FULL. Mastering these states is essential for anyone aiming to work with dynamic routing protocols. For competitive exams, questions related to OSPF often focus on how these states interact in network configurations.\n\n## **OSPF States**\n\nThe device operating OSPF goes through certain states. These states are:\n\n- **Down \u2013** In this state, no hello packets have been received on the interface.\n  - **Note \u2013** The Downstate doesn\u2019t mean that the interface is physically down. Here, it means that the OSPF adjacency process has not started yet.\n- **INIT \u2013** In this state, the hello packets have been received from the other router.\n- **2WAY \u2013** In the 2WAY state, both the routers have received the hello packets from other routers. Bidirectional connectivity has been established.\n  - **Note \u2013** In between the 2WAY state and Exstart state, the DR and BDR election takes place.\n- **Exstart \u2013** In this state, NULL DBD are exchanged. In this state, the master and slave elections take place. The router having the higher router I\u2019d become the master while the other becomes the slave. This election decides Which router will send its DBD first (routers who have formed neighbourship will take part in this election).\n- **Exchange \u2013** In this state, the actual DBDs are exchanged.\n- **Loading \u2013** In this state, LSR, LSU, and LSA (Link State Acknowledgement) are exchanged.\n\n**Important \u2013** When a router receives DBD from other router, it compares its own DBD with the other router DBD. If the received DBD is more updated than its own DBD then the router will send LSR to the other router stating what links are needed. The other router replies with the LSU containing the updates that are needed. In return to this, the router replies with the Link State Acknowledgement.\n- **Full \u2013** In this state, synchronization of all the information takes place. OSPF routing can begin only after the Full state.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-fundamentals/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol fundamentals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-fundamentals/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Networks-Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/computer-networks-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol States\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite - OSPF fundamentals Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol that is used to find the best path between the source and the destination router using its own Shortest Path First).

In dynamic routing Protocol, if the destination is unreachable then another entry, in the routing table, to the same destination can be used. One of the routing protocols is EIGRP.\n\n**EIGRP:**\n\n[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-features-enhanced-interior-gateway-routing-protocol-eigrp/) is a dynamic routing protocol that is used to find the best path between any two-layer 3 devices to deliver the packet. EIGRP works on network layer Protocol of OSI model and uses protocol number 88. It uses metrics to find out the best path between two layer 3 devices (router or layer 3 switches) operating EIGRP. Administrative Distance for EIGRP are:-\n\n| **EIGRP routes** | **AD values** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Summary Routes | 5 |\n| Internal Routes | 90 |\n| external routes | 170 |\n\nIt uses some messages to communicate with the neighbour devices that operate EIGRP. These are:-\n\n1. **Hello message-** These messages are kept alive messages which are exchanged between two devices operating EIGRP. These messages are used for neighbour discovery/recovery, if there is any device operating EIGRP or if any device(operating EIGRP) coming up again.\n\nThese messages are used for neighbor discovery if multicast at 224.0.0.10. It contains values like AS number, k values, etc.\n\nThese messages are used as acknowledgement when unicast. A hello with no data is used as the acknowledgement.\n2. **NULL update-** It is used to calculate SRTT(Smooth Round Trip Timer) and RTO(Retransmission Time Out).\n\n_SRTT:_ The time is taken by a packet to reach the neighboring router and the acknowledgement of the packet to reach the local router.\n\n_RTO:_ If a multicast fails then unicast is being sent to that router. RTO is the time for which the local router waits for an acknowledgement of the packet.\n\n3. **Full Update \u2013** After exchanging hello messages or after the neighbourship is formed, these messages are exchanged. This message contains all the best routes.\n4. **Partial update-** These messages are exchanged when there is a topology change and new links are added. It contains only the new routes, not all the routes. These messages are multicast.\n5. **Query message-** These messages are multicast when the device is declared dead and it has no routes to it in its topology table.\n6. **Reply message \u2013** These messages are the acknowledgment of the query message sent to the originator of the query message stating the route to the network which has been asked in the query message.\n7. **Acknowledgement message**\n\nIt is used to acknowledge EIGRP updates, queries, and replies. Acks are hello packets that contain no data.\n\n**Note:-** Hello and acknowledgment packets do not require any acknowledgment.\n\nReply, query, update messages are reliable messages i.e require acknowledgement.\n\n\n**Composite matrix-** The EIGRP composite metric calculation can use up to 5 variables, but only 2 are used by default (K1 and K3). The composite metric values are :\n\n_**K1 (bandwidth)**_\n\n_**K2 (load)**_\n\n_**K3 (delay)**_\n\n_**K4 (reliability)**_\n\n_**K5 (MTU)**_\n\nThe lowest bandwidth, load, delay, reliability, MTU along the path between the source and the destination is considered in the composite matrix in order to calculate the cost.\n\n**Note:-** Generally, only k1 and k3 values are used for metric calculation by EIGRP. The values are 10100 for k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 respectively.\n\n**criteria** To form EIGRP neighbourship, these criteria should be fulfilled:-\n\n1. k values should match.\n2. Autonomous system number should match. (AS is a group of networks running under a single administrative control) .\n3. authentication should match (if applied). EIGRP supports MD5 authentication only.\n4. subnet mask should be the same.\n\n**Timers:-**\n\n**Hello timer-** The interval in which EIGRP sends a hello message on an interface. It is 5 seconds by default.\n\n**Dead timer-** The interval in which the neighbor will be declared dead if it is not able to send the hello packet. It is 15 seconds by default.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/features-of-enhanced-interior-gateway-routing-protocol-eigrp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Features of Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/features-of-enhanced-interior-gateway-routing-protocol-eigrp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/qvwwujy45hz2n3kerr10)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[saurabhsharma56](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/saurabhsharma56/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n19\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

The only requirement is that each AS have at least one router that can run BGP and that is the router connected to at least one other AS\u2019s BGP router. BGP\u2019s main function is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. Border Gateway Protocol constructs an autonomous systems graph based on the information exchanged between BGP routers.\n\n## **Characteristics of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**\n\n- **Inter-Autonomous System Configuration:** The main role of BGP is to provide communication between two autonomous systems.\n- BGP supports the Next-Hop Paradigm.\n- Coordination among multiple BGP speakers within the AS (Autonomous System).\n- **Path Information:** BGP advertisements also include path information, along with the reachable destination and next destination pair.\n- **Policy Support:** BGP can implement policies that can be configured by the administrator. For ex:- a router running BGP can be configured to distinguish between the routes that are known within the AS and that which are known from outside the AS.\n- Runs Over TCP.\n- BGP conserves network Bandwidth.\n- BGP supports CIDR.\n- BGP also supports Security.\n\n**Functionality of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**\n\nBGP peers perform 3 functions, which are given below.\n\n- The first function consists of initial peer acquisition and authentication. both the peers established a TCP connection and performed message exchange that guarantees both sides have agreed to communicate.\n- The second function mainly focuses on sending negative or positive reach-ability information.\n- The third function verifies that the peers and the network connection between them are functioning correctly.\n\n## Importance of Border Gateway Protocol(BGP)\n\n- **Security:** BGP is highly secure because it authenticates messages between routers using preconfigured passwords through which unauthorized traffic is filtered out.\n- **Scalability:** BGP is more scalable because it manages a vast number of routes and networks present on the internet.\n- **Supports Multihoming:** BGP allows multihoming means an organization can connect to multiple networks simultaneously.\n- **Calculate the Best Path:** As we know data packets is traveled across the internet from source to destination every system in between the source and destination has to decide where the data packet should go next\n- **TCP/IP Model:** BGP is based on the TCP/IP model and it is used to control the network layer by using transport layer protocol.\n\n## Types of Border Gateway Protocol\n\n- **External BGP:** It is used to interchange routing information between the routers in different autonomous systems, it is also known as eBGP(External Border Gateway Protocol). The below image shows how eBGP interchange routing information.\n\n![eBGP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240108174228/eBGP-660.png)\n\neBGP\n\n- **Internal BGP:** It is used to interchange routing information between the routers in the same autonomous system, it is also known as iBGP(Internal Border Gateway Protocol). Internal routers also ensure consistency among routers for sharing routing information. The below image shows how iBGP interchange routing information.\n\n![iBGP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240108174236/iBGP-660.png)\n\niBGP\n\n## Elements of BGP\n\nSome elements of BGP are assigned to each path and these elements help routers to select a path from multiple paths.Here below are some elements of BGP:\n\n- **Weight:** Weight is defined as a Cisco-specific attribute that tells a router which path is preferred. The weight having a higher value is preferred.\n- **Originate:** This tells how a router choose routes and adds to BGP itself.\n- **Local Preference:** Local Preference is an element used to select the outbound routing path. Greater local preference is preferred.\n- **Autonomous System Path:** This element tells the router to select a path having a shorter length.\n- **Next Hop:** To reach the destination the next hop elements specify the IP address that should be used as the next hop.\n\n### **BGP Route Information Management Functions:**\n\n- **Route Storage:** Each BGP stores information about how to reach other networks.\n- **Route Update:** In this task, Special techniques are used to determine when and how to use the information received from peers to properly update the routes.\n- **Route Selection:** Each BGP uses the information in its route databases to select good routes to each network on the internet network.\n- **Route advertisement:** Each BGP speaker regularly tells their peer what is known about various networks and methods to reach them.\n\n## Difference Between BGP and OSPF\n\nHere below are some key differences between BGP and OSPF:\n\n| BGP | OSPF |\n| --- | --- |\n| It follows the Path Vector Routing Algorithm | It follows the Link State Routing Algorithm |\n| The speed of convergence is very slow in BGP | The speed of convergence is fast in the case of OSPF |\n| BGP is also called inter-domain routing protocol | OSPF is also called intra-domain routing protocol |\n| In BGP routing operation is performed between two AS | In OSPF routing operation is performed inside an AS |\n| In BGP, TCP protocol is used | In OSPF, IP protocol is used |\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on BGP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is BGP?\n\n> The main role of BGP is to provide communication between two autonomous systems.\n\n### **What is an Autonomous System**?\n\n> The Internet is a network of networks, and the large networks that comprise the Internet are autonomous systems. More precisely, a big network or collection of networks with a single routing policy is called an autonomous system (AS).\n\n### **What are BGP attributes?**\n\n> Well-known required: Incorporated into all Update messages, acknowledged by all BGP peers, and transmitted to all peers. Well-known required qualities consist of:- AS PATH, Next-hop, Origin. Popular discretionary: acknowledged by every router, transmitted to every peer, and conceivably added to the update message.\n\n### **What is BGP Peering?**\n\n> Establishing a direct physical connection between two networks\u2014typically by one or more 10GE fibers\u2014is how private peering is carried out.\n\n### **What is the BGP routing table ?**\n\n> The primary IP routing table, or BGP Routing Table, only includes the best routes. The optimal path to a network is added to the primary IP routing table by BGP once it has been determined.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exterior-gateway-protocol-egp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/exterior-gateway-protocol-egp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MKS075/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[MKS075](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MKS075/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n36\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe protocol can connect any internetwork of the autonomous system using an arbitrary topology.

This feature helps in increasing the delivery rate of IP packets.\n\nMPLS uses layer 3 service i.e, Internet Protocol, and uses router as forwarding device. The traffic of different customers is separated from each other because MPLS works somewhat like VPN. It does not work like regular VPN that encrypts the data but it ensures packet from one customer cannot be received by another customer. An MPLS header is added to packet that lies between layers 2 and 3. Hence, it is also considers to be _Layer 2.5 protocol._\n\n**MPLS Header \u2013**\n\nThe MPLS Header is 32 bit long and is divided into four parts \u2013\n\n1. **Label \u2013** This field is 20 bit long and can take value b/w 0 & 220 \u2013 1.\n\n2. **Exp \u2013** They are 3 bits long and used for _Quality of Service(QoS)_.\n\n3. **Bottom of stack (S) \u2013** It is of size 1 bit. MPLS labels are stacked one over other. If there is only one label remained in MPLS header, then its value is 1 otherwise 0.\n\n4. **Time to Live (TTL) \u2013** It is 8 bit long and its value is decreased by one at each hop to prevent packet to get stuck in network.\n\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717143429/MPLSHeader.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** MPLS Header\n\n**Important terms used in MPLS :**\n\n| Terms | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Provider Edge(PE) Router | Router at edge of MPLS network that add or remove label from IP packet. |\n| Customer Edge(CE) Router | Router at edge of customer network that send or receive IP packet from PE. |\n| Label Switch Router(LSR) | Routers used in MPLS network that can understand labels. |\n| Ingress LSR | LSR routers that receive IP packet from CE Routers and add MPLS header. |\n| Intermediate LSR | LSR routers that swap label in MPLS header and assigned for forwarding labeled IP packet. |\n| Egress LSR | LSR routers that send IP packet to CE routers and removes MPLS header. |\n| Push, Pop and Swap | Action of addition, removal and swapping of labels by LSR respectively. |\n\n[Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls-routing-work/) :\n\n**Forwarding in MPLS :**\n\nLSRs receive IP packet CE and add an MPLS header in between layer 3 and layer 2 means it encapsulates the link-layer i.e, layer 2 frames. This feature allows LSRs to support receiving packets containing frames from different protocols like Frame Relay, Metro Ethernet, etc, that\u2019s why it is called multi-protocol.\n\nMPLS forwarding is based on label attached to IP packet. This label attachment is regulated by protocol called Label Distribution Protocol(LDP). Each LSR initially learns routes as normal routers do. This learning starts with PE routers. Each PE router learns routes to different subnets from CE router. Suppose PE router PE1 learns route to subnet (say subnet1) from CE router. Now PE1 will add label to packet, forward to its neighboring LSR, and tells them that if you receive packet which destination address to subnet1 then forward it to me.\n\nAgain this process is repeated by this LSR. In this way, LSR learns routes and add this information in _Label Forwarding Information Base(LFIB)_. Now if any PE receives packet with destination to subnet1, then looking at labels and LFIB, LSRs can easily forward IP packet.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200718123835/MPLSnetwork.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** MPLS Network\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/point-to-point-protocol-ppp-suite/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Suite](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/point-to-point-protocol-ppp-suite/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/ca8e8j6qy9wk24uty26d)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/adarsh_sahni/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[adarsh\\_sahni](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/adarsh_sahni/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n8\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

It ensures that information sent from one device reaches the correct destination by using a unique set of numbers known as **IP addresses**.\n\nWhether you're browsing websites, sending emails, or watching videos, the Internet Protocol helps manage how information travels, making sure everything works smoothly and efficiently.\n\n## **Why is Internet Protocol Important?**\n\nThe Internet Protocol is a fundamental component of the Internet and computer networks, responsible for delivering packets of data from the source host to the destination host based on their IP addresses. It ensures that packets of data get to the right destination from the source device.\n\nEach device connected to a network is assigned an IP address, which serves as a \" **home address**\" for the device, enabling other devices to locate and send messages to it and providing the addressing and routing mechanisms the devices require for their communications.\n\nIP works in conjunction with the [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/) to send error messages and operational information (e.g., destination unreachable, echo requests), which inform senders about issues in packet delivery. Unlike some protocols, IP does not establish a connection before transmitting data, making it a connectionless protocol that allows for more flexible and efficient data transmission\n\n## Primary Terminologies\n\n- **IP Address:** [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) is referred as a number sticker given to each device that belongs to the network which utilizes Internet Protocol to communicate. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface recognition, identifier or location addressing.\n\n- **Packet:** A packet is a parcel of data that is switched between an origin and a destination via the Internet or some other network that is based on the [packet switching mechanism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/). This component mainly has a header and a payload.\n\n- **Router:** A router is a network device that (serves as) a forwarding point for data packets between computer networks. [Routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) carry out the traffic routing functions through the Internet.\n\n- **IPv4:** Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a protocol that tends to provide connectivity between the desktop computers online and that application layer is the wider application one that covers most of the Internet communications nowadays\n\n- **IPv6:** Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the final iteration in the series of the upgrades to the Internet Protocol, is used for the purpose of identifying, locating and routing of various computers so that traffic through Internet can be transferred properly.\n\n## How Does IP Addressing Work?\n\nEvery device connected to a network (such as the internet or a local network) needs a unique identifier so it can be located and communicated with other devices. So, the [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) serves this purpose. IP addresses are used by routers to determine how to forward data packets across the internet or a local network. This is essential for the delivery of data between devices located in different geographical regions or network segments.\n\nIP addressing uniquely identifies each device on a network using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, assigned either statically or dynamically through [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/). DNS translates human-readable domain names into these IP addresses, while protocols like ARP (for IPv4) or NDP (for IPv6) map IPs to physical [MAC addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) locally. Data is encapsulated into IP packets containing source and destination addresses, which are routed through network devices using routing tables and protocols such as OSPF or [BGP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/) to reach their target. In private networks, [NAT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat/) allows multiple devices to share a single public IP, conserving address space and enhancing security by hiding internal addresses. Upon reaching the destination, packets are decapsulated and processed by the appropriate applications. This comprehensive system ensures accurate, secure, and reliable data delivery across interconnected networks.\n\n![How-does-IP-addressing-work](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241209114045111342/How-does-IP-addressing-work.webp)Working of IP Address\n\n## Differences between IPv4 and IPv6\n\n[IPv4 and IPv6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-ipv4-and-ipv6/) are two versions of the Internet Protocol to assign internet protocol addresses to devices that could be connected to the internet.\n\nThe older version is IPv4 which uses a 32-bit address that is written in the form of four sets of numbers separated by periods, an example of which is 192.168.1.1. It provides about 4.3 billion unique addresses, sufficient at the time when it was first implemented but now running out due to the countless number of devices that join the internet.\n\nOn the other hand, IPv6 was designed to solve this problem. It uses 128-bit addresses, displayed as eight groups of four alphanumeric characters, and can generate almost limitless unique addresses.\n\nFor more details you can refer to [Internet Protocol Version 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) and [Internet Protocol Version 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv6/).\n\n## What is an IP Packet?\n\nAn [IP packets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-packet-format/) is the basic unit of data transmission in an IP network. It consists of a header and a payload:\n\n- **Header**: The header contains essential control information, such as the source and destination IP addresses, that helps routers determine where to send the packet.\n- **Payload**: The payload contains the actual data being transmitted. Once the packet reaches its destination, the data in the payload is delivered to the appropriate application or protocol\n\nTRouters examine the IP header and use the destination IP address to determine the best route for the packet. The packet may pass through multiple routers before reaching its destination. Upon arrival, the packet is decapsulated, and the payload is passed to the relevant application on the receiving device.\n\n![IP Packet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240408150643/IP-Packetdrawio.png)IP Packet\n\n## How Does the IP Routing Work?\n\n[IP routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ip-routing/) is a procedure of routing the information from the source to the recipient to enable its direction to the final destination. As we also know that the data is broken into several pieces, and then each piece will almost definitely go through several routers until these data ends up in the final destination. The path that the set of data package follows is determined by the [routing algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classification-of-routing-algorithms/).\n\nBesides the size of packet and the header length, the design of the routing algorithm takes into account other factors related to determining the most suitable route for the data from the sender to the destination. At the arrival of the datagram at some router, then source address and destination address fields are employed with a routing table to decide the subsequent hop's address.\n\n![IP-routing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241201224503099014/IP-routing.jpg)IP Routing\n\nConsidering that it runs until it ultimately arrives at its desired point. The data which is getting distributed into multiple packages will be reached destination by travelling through different independent packets.\n\n### **Example:**\n\nThe TCP layer in an email server carries out this service by means of dividing the data into packets, providing numbers to each of the packets as well as to send these packets to the IP layer. This IP layer later resends the packet to the email server becoming the destination. On the recipient server, other way around, the TCP layer separates the data packets from the IP layer and remains its original text. This command goes to the mail application.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) is the basic protocol being used in any computer network that allows devices around the Internet and any other network to communicate on their own. It plays the role of a foundation for packet processing and routing, therefore, facilitating data traffic achieving the intended recipients on time.\n\nIP knowledge is inevitable if one is working with computer networks, and it lies at the very foundation of everything that is being communicated on the network. Given that technology continues to further develop, IP becomes more and more important, being able to welcome the new challenges and demands that extremely increase the number of devices and applications over the networks worldwide.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Internet Protocol\n\n### **How are IP addresses assigned?**\n\n> IP addresses are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which distribute them to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and, ultimately, to end users.\n\n### **What is the purpose of the IP header?**\n\n> The IP header contains control information, including the source and destination IP addresses, and other details that help routers route the packet through the network.\n\n### **How does IP routing work?**\n\n> IP routing involves examining the destination IP address in a packet and consulting routing tables to determine the best path for the packet to travel across the network until it reaches its destination.\n\n### **What is IPsec?**\n\n> IPsec is a suite of protocols used to secure IP communications. It authenticates the data, ensures its integrity, and protects its confidentiality while being transmitted over the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-my-ip-address/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is My Internet Protocol (IP) Address?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-my-ip-address/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/bsgpap4an7rvtb7sphsx)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rahulrajjw9s/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[rahulrajjw9s](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rahulrajjw9s/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Internet Protocol (IP)?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Internet Protocol (IP) is a set of rules that allows computers and other devices to communicate over the Internet.

Also a new header named delivery header is added above GRE header which contains new source and destination address.\n\nGRE header act as new IP header with Delivery header containing new source and destination address. Only routers between which GRE is configured can decrypt and encrypt the GRE header. The original IP packet enters a router, travels in encrypted form and emerges out of another GRE configured router as original IP packet like they have travelled through a tunnel. Hence, this process is called GRE tunneling.\n\n**Routing Over GRE Tunnel :**\n\nThe figure shown below is a part of any enterprise network. PC1 want to communicate with server. PC1 will send packets to server. Router R1 will forward the IP packet out of its Gi0/1 interface to R2\u2019s Gi0/2 interface and packet will reach to its destination server(10.20.2.2). But When GRE is configured on the routers, then they use virtual interfaces called tunnel interfaces instead of normal router\u2019s interface. This virtual interfaces uses new IP address other than originally configured router interface IP address. These new addresses are from company\u2019s IP address pool list.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200719162417/GREnetwork.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** GRE Tunneling\n\nAfter the GRE configuration on routers, when PC1 sends packet to server in subnet 10.20.2.0/24. The router R1 receive this IP packet, encapsulate the original IP packet in a GRE header, adds new tunnel interface IP address 10.40.20.1 as source address & 10.40.20.2 as destination address in Delivery header and sends it out of the tunnel interface (tunnel0).\n\nGRE packet now travel through path in network defined by various routing protocols and reaches R2\u2019s tunnel interface(tunnel 1). R2 upon receiving the GRE packet, decrypt the packet i.e, removes delivery and GRE header. R2 now forwards the IP packet according to original destination address to the server. Also IP routing table of GRE enabled router get changed and contains information as shown in figure.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200719162419/GRErouting.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** GRE Tunneling\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-in-ip-encapsulation/?ref=next_article)\n\n[IP-in-IP Encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ip-in-ip-encapsulation/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/ca8e8j6qy9wk24uty26d)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/adarsh_sahni/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[adarsh\\_sahni](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/adarsh_sahni/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Networks-Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/computer-networks-network-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Tunnel\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation is a method of encapsulation of IP packet in a GRE header which hides the original IP packet.

The data packets must be taken and sent to the appropriate machine by the network layer. After that, the transport layer receives the packets, sorts them, and looks for faults. Subsequently, it directs them to the session layer of the appropriate computer program. Now, the properly structured packets are used by the session layer to hold the data for the application.\n\n![28](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128105728883826/28.webp)\n\nTransport Layer in OSI Model\n\n## Functions of Transport Layer\n\nThe Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication of data packets. It provides a number of important functions that are responsible for reliable, efficient, and organized data transfer between host systems in a networked environment.\n\nThe primary functions of the Transport Layer are:\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128113727451828/functions_of_transport_layer.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128113727451828/functions_of_transport_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442074617/functions_of_transport_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442074617/functions_of_transport_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442228211/functions_of_transport_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442228211/functions_of_transport_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442410722/functions_of_transport_layer_4.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442410722/functions_of_transport_layer_4.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442595408/functions_of_transport_layer_5.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442595408/functions_of_transport_layer_5.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442751323/functions_of_transport_layer_6.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442751323/functions_of_transport_layer_6.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442891920/functions_of_transport_layer_7.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175442891920/functions_of_transport_layer_7.webp)\n\n![functions_of_transport_layer_8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175443040652/functions_of_transport_layer_8.webp)![functions_of_transport_layer_8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124175443040652/functions_of_transport_layer_8.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 8\n\nTo read in detail about services offered by transport layer, refer to [Transport Layer Services](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-services/)\n\n## Working of Transport Layer\n\nCommunication between end systems is dependable and effective thanks to the Transport Layer. Apart from regulating flow and accommodating numerous applications concurrently, it guarantees data delivery in a manner that guarantees accuracy and minimises mistakes. It accomplishes this by utilising a collection of methods and protocols that provide data transport.\n\n![Working of Transport-layer](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230623142335/Transport-layer-660.jpg)\n\n- The primary function of the transport layer is to give application processes operating on several hosts direct access to communication services.\n- Logical communication between application processes operating on separate hosts is facilitated by the transport layer. Application processes use the logical communication offered by the transport layer to deliver messages to one other even when they are running on different hosts and are not physically connected.\n- The network routers do not implement the transport layer protocols; only the end systems do.\n- For instance, the network layer receives services from TCP and UDP, two transport layer protocols, which offer distinct functionalities.\n- Protocols at the transport layer offer multiplexing and demultiplexing capabilities. In addition, it offers other services including bandwidth assurances, latency guarantees, and dependable data transport.\n- Every application at the application layer is capable of sending a message via either TCP or UDP. Either of these two protocols can be used by the application to interact. The internet protocol on the internet layer will then be communicated with by both TCP and UDP. The transport layer is readable and writeable by the applications.\n\n## Transport Layer Protocols\n\nTransport Layer Protocol uses different protocol for the better communication between two ends uses of protocol may differ from specifications. Below mention are some protocols used in Transport Layer\n\n### **1\\. Transmission Control Protocol(TCP)**\n\n- [**TCP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is connection-oriented Protocol.\n- TCP is reliable protocol.\n- As TCP is connection-oriented protocol, so first the connection is established between two ends and then data is transferred and then the connection is terminated after all data being sent.\n\n### **2\\. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**\n\n- [**UDP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is not reliable protocol\n- The protocol UDP is connectionless.\n- When speed and size are more important than security and dependability, this kind of protocol is employed.\n- The data from the higher layer is supplemented with transport-level addresses, checksum error control, and length information by UDP, an end-to-end transport level protocol.\n- A user datagram is the packet that the UDP protocol generates.\n\n### **3\\. Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)**\n\n- Many Internet applications use SCTP to perform transport layer duties, similar to User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n- On top of a connectionless packet network like IP, SCTP is a dependable transport protocol that facilitates data transfer over the network in scenarios involving one or more IP addresses.\n\n## Difference Between TCP and UDP at Transport Layer\n\n| TCP | UDP |\n| --- | --- |\n| TCP\u00a0is a connection-oriented protocol | UDP\u00a0is the connection-less protocol |\n| TCP is reliable. | UDP is not reliable. |\n| TCP supports error-checking mechanisms. | UDP has only the basic error-checking mechanism using checksums. |\n| An acknowledgment segment is present. | No acknowledgment segment. |\n| TCP is slower than UDP | UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP. |\n| Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. | There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) |\n| TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header. | The header length is fixed of 8 bytes. |\n\n**For practice, solve** [**quiz on Transport Layer**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quizzes/transport-layer-gq/?ref=quiz_lbp) **.**\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Transport Layer \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is Transport Layer**\n\n> The transport layer, or layer 4 of the OSI model, controls network traffic between hosts and end systems to guarantee full data flows.

It is one of the main protocols of the [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) suite. In [OSI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) model, it operates at the [transport layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-in-osi-model/)(Layer 4). It lies between the [Application](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/) and [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-in-osi-model/) s which are used in providing reliable delivery services. The [Internet Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-internet-protocol-ip/) (IP), which establishes the technique for sending data packets between computers, works with TCP.\n\n- TCP establishes a reliable connection between sender and receiver using the **three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)** and it uses a **four-step handshake (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK)** to close connections properly.\n- It ensures **error-free, in-order delivery** of data packets.\n- It uses **acknowledgments (ACKs)** to confirm receipt.\n- It prevents data overflow by adjusting the data transmission rate according to the receiver\u2019s buffer size.\n- It prevents network congestion using algorithms like **Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery.**\n- TCP header uses **checksum** to detect corrupted data and requests retransmission if needed.\n- It is used in applications requiring **reliable** and **ordered** data transfer, such as web browsing, email, and remote login.\n\n## Internet Protocol (IP)\n\n[Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6/) is a method that is useful for sending data from one device to another from all over the internet. It is a set of rules governing how data is sent and received over the internet. It is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so they can travel from the sender to the correct destination across multiple networks. Every device contains a unique IP Address that helps it communicate and exchange data across other devices present on the internet.\n\n## Working of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\n**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** model breaks down the data into small bundles and afterward reassembles the bundles into the original message on the opposite end to make sure that each message reaches its target location intact. Sending the information in little bundles of information makes it simpler to maintain efficiency as opposed to sending everything in one go.\n\nAfter a particular message is broken down into bundles, these bundles may travel along multiple routes if one route is jammed but the destination remains the same.\n\n![Transmission Control Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240226095336/TCP-Gif.gif)\n\nTCP\n\n**For Example:** When a user requests a web page on the internet, somewhere in the world, the server processes that request and sends back an HTML Page to that user. The server makes use of a protocol called the HTTP Protocol. The [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) then requests the TCP layer to set the required connection and send the HTML file.\n\nNow, the TCP breaks the data into small packets and forwards it toward the Internet Protocol (IP) layer. The packets are then sent to the destination through different routes.\n\nThe TCP layer in the user\u2019s system waits for the transmission to get finished and acknowledges once all packets have been received.\n\n## Features of TCP\n\nSome of the most prominent features of Transmission control protocol are mentioned below.\n\n- **Segment Numbering System:** TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to each and every single one of them. A specific Byte Number is assigned to data bytes that are to be transferred while segments are assigned sequence numbers. Acknowledgment Numbers are assigned to received segments.\n- **Connection Oriented:** Itmeans sender and receiver are connected to each other till the completion of the process. The order of the data is maintained i.e. order remains same before and after transmission.\n- **Full Duplex:** In TCP data can be transmitted from receiver to the sender or vice \u2013 versa at the same time. It increases efficiency of data flow between sender and receiver.\n- **Flow Control:** Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery. The receiver continually hints to the sender on how much data can be received (using a sliding window).\n- **Error Control:** TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer. Error control is byte-oriented. Segments are checked for error detection. Error Control includes \u2013 Corrupted Segment & Lost Segment Management, Out-of-order segments, Duplicate segments, etc.\n- **Congestion Control:** TCP takes into account the level of congestion in the network. Congestion level is determined by the amount of data sent by a sender.\n\n## **Advantages of TCP**\n\n- It is a reliable protocol.\n- It provides an error-checking mechanism as well as one for recovery.\n- It gives flow control.\n- It makes sure that the data reaches the proper destination in the exact order that it was sent.\n- It is a well-documented and widely implemented protocol, maintained by standards organizations like the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).\n- It works in conjunction with IP (Internet Protocol) to establish connections between devices on a network.\n\n## **Disadvantages of TCP**\n\n- TCP is made for Wide Area Networks, thus its size can become an issue for small networks with low resources.\n- TCP runs several layers so it can slow down the speed of the network.\n- It is not generic in nature. It cannot represent any protocol stack other than the TCP/IP suite. E.g., it cannot work with a Bluetooth connection.\n- No modifications since their development around 30 years ago.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is three-way handshake in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?\n\n> [Three Way Handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/) is a process that is used to establish a connection between Client and Server. It has three steps of process.\n\n### What is the purpose of TCP Header?\n\n> TCP Header contains the important information for the proper delivery of the data.

For Unreliable data transfer, [User Datagram Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is a better choice.\n\n### Is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol(IP) same?\n\n> TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are not the same, but they work together in the TCP/IP suite to enable internet communication. TCP ensures reliable data transmission by managing the breakdown and reassembly of data packets, while IP handles addressing and routing these packets to the correct destination.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP 3-Way Handshake Process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/146im5anmr1def9ch02l)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/jaygala260/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[jaygala260](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/jaygala260/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n79\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment. In this article, we will discuss the TCP 3-Way Handshake Process.\n\n## What is the TCP 3-Way Handshake?\n\nThe TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process used in the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server before data transmission begins. This handshake ensures that both parties are synchronized and ready for communication.\n\n## TCP Segment Structure\n\nA TCP segment consists of data bytes to be sent and a header that is added to the data by TCP as shown:\n\n![TCP Segment](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/TCPSegmentHeader-1.png)\n\nThe header of a TCP segment can range from 20-60 bytes. 40 bytes are for options. If there are no options, a header is 20 bytes else it can be of upmost 60 bytes.\u00a0Header fields:\n\n- **Source Port Address:** A 16-bit field that holds the port address of the application that is sending the data segment.\n- **Destination Port Address:** A 16-bit field that holds the port address of the application in the host that is receiving the data segment.\n- **Sequence Number:** A 32-bit field that holds the [sequence number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wrap-around-concept-and-tcp-sequence-number/) , i.e, the byte number of the first byte that is sent in that particular segment. It is used to reassemble the message at the receiving end of the segments that are received out of order.\n- **Acknowledgement Number:** A 32-bit field that holds the acknowledgement number, i.e, the byte number that the receiver expects to receive next. It is an acknowledgement for the previous bytes being received successfully.\n- **Header Length (HLEN):** This is a 4-bit field that indicates the length of the TCP header by a number of 4-byte words in the header, i.e if the header is 20 bytes(min length of [TCP header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/services-and-segment-structure-in-tcp/) ), then this field will hold 5 (because 5 x 4 = 20) and the maximum length: 60 bytes, then it\u2019ll hold the value 15(because 15 x 4 = 60). Hence, the value of this field is always between 5 and 15.\n- **Control flags:** These are 6 1-bit control bits that control connection establishment, connection termination, connection abortion, flow control, mode of transfer etc. Their function is:\n  - URG: Urgent pointer is valid\n  - ACK: Acknowledgement number is valid( used in case of cumulative acknowledgement)\n  - PSH: Request for push\n  - RST: Reset the connection\n  - SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers\n  - FIN: Terminate the connection\n- **Window size:** This field tells the window size of the sending TCP in bytes.\n- **Checksum:** This field holds the checksum for [error control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-control-in-data-link-layer/) . It is mandatory in TCP as opposed to UDP.\n- **Urgent pointer:** This field (valid only if the URG control flag is set) is used to point to data that is urgently required that needs to reach the receiving process at the earliest. The value of this field is added to the sequence number to get the byte number of the last urgent byte.\n\n## TCP 3-way Handshake Process\n\nThe process of communication between devices over the internet happens according to the current **TCP/IP** suite model(stripped-out version of OSI reference model). The [Application layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/) is a top pile of a stack of TCP/IP models from where network-referenced applications like web browsers on the client side establish a connection with the server. From the application layer, the information is transferred to the transport layer where our topic comes into the picture. The two important protocols of this layer are \u2013 TCP, and [**UDP(User Datagram Protocol)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) out of which TCP is prevalent(since it provides reliability for the connection established). However, you can find an application of UDP in querying the [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) server to get the binary equivalent of the Domain Name used for the website.\n\n![TCP 3 Way Handshaking](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/handshake-1.png)\n\nTCP provides reliable communication with something called **Positive Acknowledgement with Re-transmission(PAR)** . The Protocol Data Unit(PDU) of the transport layer is called a segment. Now a device using PAR resend the data unit until it receives an acknowledgement. If the data unit received at the receiver\u2019s end is damaged(It checks the data with [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) functionality of the transport layer that is used for [Error Detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/) ), the receiver discards the segment. So the sender has to resend the data unit for which positive acknowledgement is not received. You can realize from the above mechanism that three segments are exchanged between sender(client) and receiver(server) for a reliable TCP connection to get established. Let us delve into how this mechanism works\n\n![TCP 3 Way Handshake](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/TCP-connection-1.png)\n\n- **Step 1 (SYN):** In the first step, the client wants to establish a connection with a server, so it sends a segment with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) which informs the server that the client is likely to start communication and with what sequence number it starts segments with\n- **Step 2 (SYN + ACK):** Server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. Acknowledgement(ACK) signifies the response of the segment it received and SYN signifies with what sequence number it is likely to start the segments with\n- **Step 3 (ACK):** In the final part client acknowledges the response of the server and they both establish a reliable connection with which they will start the actual data transfer\n\n## Question For Practice\n\n**Question:** Consider a TCP client and a TCP server running on two different machines. After completing the data transfer, the TCP client calls **close** to terminate the connection and a FIN segment is sent to the TCP server. Server-side TCP responds by sending an ACK which is received by the client-side TCP. As per the TCP connection state diagram(RFC 793), in which state does the client-side TCP connection wait for the FIN from the server-side TCP? **\\[GATE-CS-2017 (Set 1)\\]**\n\n(A) LAST-ACK\n\n(B) TIME-WAIT\n\n(C) FIN-WAIT-1\n\n(D) FIN-WAIT-2\n\n> **Explanation :** (D)\u00a0For detail solution visit the article. [GATE PYQs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/questions/gate-gate-cs-2017-set-1-question-12/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe TCP 3-Way Handshake is a critical mechanism for establishing a secure connection between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network. It consists of three important steps: the client initiates the connection by sending an SYN packet, the server responds with a SYN-ACK message to acknowledge the client\u2019s request and synchronize sequence numbers, and the client sends an ACK packet to complete the connection. This handshake ensures that both sides are in sync and prepared for dependable data transmission, making it an essential mechanism for stable and secure communication in TCP/IP networks.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on TCP 3-Way Handshake Process \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is the purpose of the SYN flag in the TCP three-way handshake?**\n\n> The SYN (Synchronize Sequence Number) flag is used in the initial step of the handshake.\u00a0It informs the server that the client wants to establish a connection and specifies the sequence number for subsequent segments  .\n\n### **Why is a three-way handshake necessary in TCP/IP networks?**\n\n> The three-way handshake ensures reliable communication by establishing a connection between the client and server.\u00a0It confirms that both parties are ready for data transfer and synchronizes their sequence numbers.\n\n### **How does the TCP three-way handshake affect network security?**\n\n> The handshake helps prevent unauthorized connections.\u00a0Without it, malicious actors could potentially establish connections without proper synchronization\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n271\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

It works together with IP and provides a reliable transport service between processes using the network layer service provided by the IP protocol.\n\nThe various **services** provided by the TCP to the application layer are as follows:\n\n1. **Process-to-Process Communication \u2013**\n\nTCP provides a process to process communication, i.e, the transfer of data that takes place between individual processes executing on end systems. This is done using port numbers or port addresses. Port numbers are 16 bits long that help identify which process is sending or receiving data on a host.\n\n2. **Stream oriented \u2013**\n\nThis means that the data is sent and received as a stream of bytes(unlike UDP or IP that divides the bits into datagrams or packets). However, the network layer, that provides service for the TCP, sends packets of information not streams of bytes. Hence, TCP groups a number of bytes together into a _segment_ and adds a header to each of these segments and then delivers these segments to the network layer. At the network layer, each of these segments is encapsulated in an IP packet for transmission. The TCP header has information that is required for control purposes which will be discussed along with the segment structure.\n\n3. **Full-duplex service \u2013**\n\nThis means that the communication can take place in both directions at the same time.\n\n4. **Connection-oriented service \u2013**\n\nUnlike UDP, TCP provides a connection-oriented service. It defines 3 different phases:\n\n   - Connection establishment\n   - Data transfer\n   - Connection termination\n5. **Reliability \u2013**\n\nTCP is reliable as it uses checksum for error detection, attempts to recover lost or corrupted packets by re-transmission, acknowledgement policy and timers. It uses features like byte number and sequence number and acknowledgement number so as to ensure reliability. Also, it uses congestion control mechanisms.\n\n6. **Multiplexing \u2013**\n\nTCP does multiplexing and de-multiplexing at the sender and receiver ends respectively as a number of logical connections can be established between port numbers over a physical connection.\n\n\n**Byte number, Sequence number and Acknowledgement number:**\n\nAll the data bytes that are to be transmitted are numbered and the beginning of this numbering is arbitrary. Sequence numbers are given to the segments so as to reassemble the bytes at the receiver end even if they arrive in a different order. The sequence number of a segment is the byte number of the first byte that is being sent. The acknowledgement number is required since TCP provides full-duplex service. The acknowledgement number is the next byte number that the receiver expects to receive which also provides acknowledgement for receiving the previous bytes.\n\nExample:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/tcp1-2.png)\n\nIn this example we see that A sends acknowledgement number1001, which means that it has received data bytes till byte number 1000 and expects to receive 1001 next, hence B next sends data bytes starting from 1001. Similarly, since B has received data bytes till byte number 13001 after the first data transfer from A to B, therefore B sends acknowledgement number 13002, the byte number that it expects to receive from A next.\n\n**TCP Segment structure \u2013**\n\nA TCP segment consists of data bytes to be sent and a header that is added to the data by TCP as shown:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/TCPSegmentHeader-1.png)\n\nThe header of a TCP segment can range from 20-60 bytes. 40 bytes are for options. If there are no options, a header is 20 bytes else it can be of upmost 60 bytes.\n\nHeader fields:\n\n- **Source Port Address \u2013**\n\nA 16-bit field that holds the port address of the application that is sending the data segment.\n\n- **Destination Port Address \u2013**\n\nA 16-bit field that holds the port address of the application in the host that is receiving the data segment.\n\n- **Sequence Number \u2013**\n\nA 32-bit field that holds the sequence number, i.e, the byte number of the first byte that is sent in that particular segment. It is used to reassemble the message at the receiving end of the segments that are received out of order.\n\n- **Acknowledgement Number \u2013**\n\nA 32-bit field that holds the acknowledgement number, i.e, the byte number that the receiver expects to receive next. It is an acknowledgement for the previous bytes being received successfully.\n\n- **Header Length (HLEN) \u2013**\n\nThis is a 4-bit field that indicates the length of the TCP header by a number of 4-byte words in the header, i.e if the header is 20 bytes(min length of TCP header), then this field will hold 5 (because 5 x 4 = 20) and the maximum length: 60 bytes, then it\u2019ll hold the value 15(because 15 x 4 = 60). Hence, the value of this field is always between 5 and 15.\n\n- **Control flags \u2013**\n\nThese are 6 1-bit control bits that control connection establishment, connection termination, connection abortion, flow control, mode of transfer etc. Their function is:\n\n  - URG: Urgent pointer is valid\n  - ACK: Acknowledgement number is valid( used in case of cumulative acknowledgement)\n  - PSH: Request for push\n  - RST: Reset the connection\n  - SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers\n  - FIN: Terminate the connection\n- **Window size \u2013**\n\nThis field tells the window size of the sending TCP in bytes.\n\n- **Checksum \u2013**\n\nThis field holds the checksum for error control. It is mandatory in TCP as opposed to UDP.\n\n- **Urgent pointer \u2013**\n\nThis field (valid only if the URG control flag is set) is used to point to data that is urgently required that needs to reach the receiving process at the earliest. The value of this field is added to the sequence number to get the byte number of the last urgent byte.\n\n\n**TCP Connection \u2013**\n\nTCP is connection-oriented. A [TCP connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-connection-establishment/) is established by a [3-way handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-3-way-handshake-process/).\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-connection-establishment/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP Connection Establishment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-connection-establishment/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/me_l/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[me\\_l](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/me_l/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n61\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Understanding each step of this handshake process is critical for networking professionals.\n\n1\\. Sender starts the process with the following:\n\n- **Sequence number (Seq=521):** contains the random initial sequence number generated at the sender side.\n- **Syn flag (Syn=1):** request the receiver to synchronize its sequence number with the above-provided sequence number.\n- **Maximum segment size (MSS=1460 B):** sender tells its maximum segment size, so that receiver sends datagram which won\u2019t require any fragmentation. MSS field is present inside **Option** field in TCP header.\n- **Window size (window=14600 B):** sender tells about his buffer capacity in which he has to store messages from the receiver.\n\n2\\. TCP is a full-duplex protocol so both sender and receiver require a window for receiving messages from one another.\n\n- **Sequence number (Seq=2000):** contains the random initial sequence number generated at the receiver side.\n- **Syn flag (Syn=1):** request the sender to synchronize its sequence number with the above-provided sequence number.\n- **Maximum segment size (MSS=500 B):** receiver tells its maximum segment size, so that sender sends datagram which won\u2019t require any fragmentation. MSS field is present inside **Option** field in TCP header.\n\nSince MSS  receiver  < MSS  sender  , both parties agree for minimum MSS i.e., 500 B to avoid fragmentation of packets at both ends.\n\n```\nTherefore, receiver can send maximum of 14600/500 = 29 packets.\nThis is the receiver's sending window size.\n```\n\n- **Window size (window=10000 B):** receiver tells about his buffer capacity in which he has to store messages from the sender.\n\n```\nTherefore, sender can send a maximum of 10000/500 = 20 packets.\nThis is the sender's sending window size.\n```\n\n- **Acknowledgement Number (Ack no.=522):** Since sequence number 521 is received by the receiver so, it makes a request for the next sequence number with Ack no.=522 which is the next packet expected by the receiver since Syn flag consumes 1 sequence no.\n- **ACK flag (ACk=1):** tells that the acknowledgement number field contains the next sequence expected by the receiver.\n\n3\\. Sender makes the final reply for connection establishment in the following way:\n\n- **Sequence number (Seq=522):** since sequence number = 521 in 1  st  step and SYN flag consumes one sequence number hence, the next sequence number will be 522.\n- **Acknowledgement Number (Ack no.=2001):** since the sender is acknowledging SYN=1 packet from the receiver with sequence number 2000 so, the next sequence number expected is 2001.\n- **ACK flag (ACK=1):** tells that the acknowledgement number field contains the next sequence expected by the sender.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/net.png)\n\nSince the connection establishment phase of TCP makes use of 3 packets, it is also known as [3-way Handshaking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-3-way-handshake-process/) **(SYN, SYN + ACK, ACK).**\n\n- **GATE question \u2013** [GATE IT 2008 \\| Question 67](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-it-2008-question-67/)\n\nRelated next article \u2013 [TCP Connection Termination](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-tcp-connection-termination/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-connection-termination/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP Connection Termination](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-connection-termination/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit87/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Ankit87](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit87/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n46\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

In this article, we will study how TCP close connection between Client and Server. Here we will also need to send bit segments to a server which **FIN** bit is set to 1.\n\nTCP supports two types of connection releases like most connection-oriented transport protocols:\n\n1. **Graceful connection release \u2013**\n\n    In the Graceful connection release, the connection is open until both parties have closed their sides of the connection.\n2. **Abrupt connection release \u2013**\n\n    In an Abrupt connection release, either one TCP entity is forced to close the connection or one user closes both directions of data transfer.\n\n**Abrupt connection release :**\n\nAn abrupt connection release is carried out when an RST segment is sent. An RST segment can be sent for the below reasons:\n\n1. When a non-SYN segment was received for a non-existing TCP connection.\n2. In an open connection, some TCP implementations send an RST segment when a segment with an invalid header is received. This will prevent attacks by closing the corresponding connection.\n3. When some implementations need to close an existing TCP connection, they send an RST segment. They will close an existing TCP connection for the following reasons:\n   - Lack of resources to support the connection\n   - The remote host is now unreachable and has stopped responding.\n\nWhen a TCP entity sends an RST segment, it should contain 00 if it does not belong to any existing connection else it should contain the current value of the sequence number for the connection and the acknowledgment number should be set to the next expected in- sequence number on this connection.\n\n**Graceful Connection Release :**\n\nThe common way of terminating a TCP connection is by using the TCP header\u2019s FIN flag. This mechanism allows each host to release its own side of the connection individually.\n\n![11](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/CN.png)How mechanism works In TCP :\n\n1. **Step 1 (FIN From Client) \u2013**\n\n    Suppose that the client application decides it wants to close the connection. (Note that the server could also choose to close the connection). This causes the client to send a TCP segment with the **FIN** bit set to **1** to the server and to enter the **FIN\\_WAIT\\_1** state. While in the **FIN\\_WAIT\\_1** state, the client waits for a TCP segment from the server with an acknowledgment (ACK).\n2. **Step 2 (ACK From Server) \u2013**\n\n    When the Server received the FIN bit segment from Sender (Client), Server Immediately sends acknowledgement (ACK) segment to the Sender (Client).\n3. **Step 3 (Client waiting) \u2013**\n\n    While in the **FIN\\_WAIT\\_1** state, the client waits for a TCP segment from the server with an acknowledgment. When it receives this segment, the client enters the **FIN\\_WAIT\\_2** state. While in the **FIN\\_WAIT\\_2** state, the client waits for another segment from the server with the FIN bit set to 1.\n4. **Step 4 (FIN from Server) \u2013**\n\n    The server sends the FIN bit segment to the Sender(Client) after some time when the Server sends the ACK segment (because of some closing process in the Server).\n5. **Step 5 (ACK from Client) \u2013**\n\n    When the Client receives the FIN bit segment from the Server, the client acknowledges the server\u2019s segment and enters the **TIME\\_WAIT** state. The **TIME\\_WAIT** state lets the client resend the final acknowledgment in case the **ACK** is lost. The time spent by clients in the **TIME\\_WAIT** state depends on their implementation, but their typical values are 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes. After the wait, the connection formally closes and all resources on the client-side (including port numbers and buffer data) are released.\n\nTCP connection termination involves a four-way handshake to gracefully end the connection between two devices. Understanding each step\u2014FIN, ACK, and how timers work\u2014is critical for networking professionals and students alike. Since exam scenarios often require in-depth knowledge of protocols like TCP, studying additional material that covers both theoretical and practical aspects can be very helpful. For example, [**this GATE CS and IT \u2013 2025 course**](https://gfgcdn.com/tu/Ry0/) goes beyond the basics and dives into real-world applications, ensuring you\u2019re well-prepared for both exams and practical implementations.\n\nIn the below Figures illustrate the series of states visited by the server-side and also the Client-side, assuming the client begins connection tear-down. In these two state-transition figures, we have only shown how a TCP connection is normally established and shut down.\n\nTCP states visited by ClientSide \u2013\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/CN-1.png)\n\nTCP states visited by ServerSide \u2013\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/CN-2.png)\n\nHere we have not described what happens in certain scenarios like when both sides of a connection want to initiate or shut down at the same time. If you are interested in learning more about this and other advanced issues concerning TCP, you are encouraged to see Stevens\u2019comprehensive book.\n\n**GATE Question \u2013**\n\nConsider a TCP client and a TCP server running on two different machines. After completing the data transfer, the TCP client calls **close** to terminate the connection and a FIN segment is sent to the TCP server. Server-side TCP responds by sending an ACK which is received by the client-side TCP. As per the TCP connection state diagram(RFC 793), in which state does the client-side TCP connection wait for the FIN from the server-side TCP?\n\n(A) LAST-ACK\n\n(B) TIME-WAIT\n\n(C) FIN-WAIT-1\n\n(D) FIN-WAIT-2\n\n**Explanation :** (D)\n\n[GATE CS 2017 (Set 1), Question 12](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2017-set-1-question-12/)\n\n**References \u2013**\n\n[TCP Connection Termination \u2013 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Connection_termination)\n\n[http://www.bau.edu.jo/UserPortal/UserProfile/PostsAttach/10617\\_1870\\_1.pdf](http://www.bau.edu.jo/UserPortal/UserProfile/PostsAttach/10617_1870_1.pdf)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-timers/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP Timers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-timers/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Just like traffic congestion on a busy road, network congestion leads to delays and sometimes data loss. When the network can\u2019t handle all the incoming data, it gets \u201cclogged,\u201d making it difficult for information to travel smoothly from one place to another.\n\nCongestion control is a crucial concept in computer networks. It refers to the methods used to prevent network overload and ensure smooth data flow.Congestion control techniques help manage the traffic, so all users can enjoy a stable and efficient network connection. These techniques are essential for maintaining the performance and reliability of modern networks.\n\n## Effects of Congestion Control\n\n- **Improved Network Stability**: Congestion control helps keep the network stable by preventing it from getting overloaded. It manages the flow of data so the network doesn\u2019t crash or fail due to too much traffic.\n- **Reduced Latency and Packet Loss**: Without congestion control, **data transmission** can slow down, causing [delays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/delays-in-computer-network/) and data loss. [Congestion control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-in-computer-networks/) helps manage traffic better, reducing these delays and ensuring fewer data packets are lost, making data transfer faster and the network more responsive.\n- **Enhanced Throughput**: By avoiding congestion, the network can use its resources more effectively. This means more data can be sent in a shorter time, which is important for handling large amounts of data and supporting high-speed applications.\n- **Fairness in Resource Allocation**: Congestion control ensures that network resources are shared fairly among users. No single user or application can take up all the [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/), allowing everyone to have a fair share.\n- **Better User Experience**: When data flows smoothly and quickly, users have a better experience. Websites, online services, and applications work more reliably and without annoying delays.\n- **Mitigation of Network Congestion Collapse**: Without congestion control, a sudden spike in data traffic can overwhelm the network, causing severe congestion and making it almost unusable. Congestion control helps prevent this by managing traffic efficiently and avoiding such critical breakdowns.\n\n## Congestion Control Algorithm\n\nCongestion Control is a mechanism that controls the entry of data packets into the network, enabling a better use of a shared network infrastructure and avoiding congestive collapse.\u00a0**Congestive-avoidance algorithms** (CAA) are implemented at the [TCP layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) as the mechanism to avoid congestive collapse in a network.There are two congestion control algorithms which are as follows:\n\n### Leaky Bucket Algorithm\n\n- The leaky bucket algorithm discovers its use in the context of network traffic shaping or rate-limiting.\n- A leaky bucket execution and a token bucket execution are predominantly used for traffic shaping algorithms.\n- This algorithm is used to control the rate at which traffic is sent to the network and shape the burst traffic to a steady traffic stream.\n- The disadvantages compared with the leaky-bucket algorithm are the inefficient use of available network resources.\n- The large area of network resources such as [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) is not being used effectively.\n\nLet us consider an example to understand. Imagine a bucket with a small hole in the bottom. No matter at what rate water enters the bucket, the outflow is at constant rate. When the bucket is full with water additional water entering spills over the sides and is lost.\n\n![Leaky-Bucket](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250206174904607346/Leaky-Bucket.png)\n\nLeaky Bucket\n\nSimilarly, each network interface contains a leaky bucket and the following steps are involved in leaky bucket algorithm:\n\n- When host wants to send packet, packet is thrown into the bucket.\n- The bucket leaks at a constant rate, meaning the network interface transmits packets at a constant rate.\n- Bursty traffic is converted to a uniform traffic by the leaky bucket.\n- In practice the bucket is a finite queue that outputs at a finite rate.\n\nRead in detail about [**Leaky Bucket Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/)\n\n### Token Bucket Algorithm\n\n- The leaky bucket algorithm has a rigid output design at an average rate independent of the bursty traffic.\n- In some applications, when large bursts arrive, the output is allowed to speed up. This calls for a more flexible algorithm, preferably one that never loses information. Therefore, a token bucket algorithm finds its uses in network traffic shaping or rate-limiting.\n- It is a control algorithm that indicates when traffic should be sent. This order comes based on the display of tokens in the bucket.\n- The bucket contains tokens. Each of the tokens defines a packet of predetermined size. Tokens in the bucket are deleted for the ability to share a packet.\n- When tokens are shown, a flow to transmit traffic appears in the display of tokens.\n- \u00a0No token means no flow sends its packets. Hence, a flow transfers traffic up to its peak burst rate in good tokens in the bucket.\n\nRead in detail about [**Token Bucket Algorithm**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/token-bucket-algorithm/)\n\n## Need of Token Bucket Algorithm\n\nThe leaky bucket algorithm enforces output pattern at the average rate, no matter how bursty the traffic is. So in order to deal with the bursty traffic we need a flexible algorithm so that the data is not lost. One such algorithm is token bucket algorithm.\n\nSteps of this algorithm can be described as follows:\n\n- In regular intervals tokens are thrown into the bucket.\n- The bucket has a maximum capacity.\n- If there is a ready packet, a token is removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent.\n- If there is no token in the bucket, the packet cannot be sent.\n\nLet\u2019s understand with an example, In figure (A) we see a bucket holding three tokens, with five packets waiting to be transmitted. For a packet to be transmitted, it must capture and destroy one token. In figure (B) We see that three of the five packets have gotten through, but the other two are stuck waiting for more tokens to be generated.\n\n## **Token Bucket vs Leaky Bucket**\n\nThe [leaky bucket algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/) controls the rate at which the packets are introduced in the network, but it is very conservative in nature. Some flexibility is introduced in the token bucket algorithm. In the [token bucket algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/token-bucket-algorithm/), tokens are generated at each tick (up to a certain limit). For an incoming packet to be transmitted, it must capture a token and the transmission takes place at the same rate. Hence some of the busty packets are transmitted at the same rate if tokens are available and thus introduces some amount of flexibility in the system.\n\n![Screenshot-2025-01-25-163856](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250125163936255323/Screenshot-2025-01-25-163856.png)\n\nLeaky Bucket\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Stable Network Operation**: Congestion control ensures that networks remain stable and operational by preventing them from becoming overloaded with too much data traffic.\n- **Reduced Delays**: It minimizes delays in data transmission by managing traffic flow effectively, ensuring that data packets reach their destinations promptly.\n- **Less Data Loss**: By regulating the amount of data in the network at any given time, congestion control reduces the likelihood of data packets being lost or discarded.\n- **Optimal Resource Utilization**: It helps networks use their resources efficiently, allowing for better [throughput](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bandwidth-and-throughput/) and ensuring that users can access data and services without interruptions.\n- **Scalability**: Congestion control mechanisms are scalable, allowing networks to handle increasing volumes of data traffic as they grow without compromising performance.\n- **Adaptability**: Modern congestion control algorithms can adapt to changing network conditions, ensuring optimal performance even in dynamic and unpredictable environments.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- **Complexity**: Implementing congestion control algorithms can add complexity to network management, requiring sophisticated systems and configurations.\n- **Overhead**: Some congestion control techniques introduce additional overhead, which can consume network resources and affect overall performance.\n- **Algorithm Sensitivity**: The effectiveness of congestion control algorithms can be sensitive to network conditions and configurations, requiring fine-tuning for optimal performance.\n- **Resource Allocation Issues**: Fairness in [resource allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/resource-allocation/), while a benefit, can also pose challenges when trying to prioritize critical applications over less essential ones.\n- **Dependency on Network Infrastructure**: Congestion control relies on the underlying network infrastructure and may be less effective in environments with outdated or unreliable equipment.\n\n## Congestion Control \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Why is congestion control important?**\n\n> Congestion control is important because it helps prevent network overload, ensuring smooth and efficient data flow. This keeps the network stable and reliable for all users.\n\n### **How does congestion affect network performance?**\n\n> When a network is congested, data packets can get delayed, lost, or need to be retransmitted, leading to slower speeds and reduced overall performance.\n\n### **What is TCP congestion control?**\n\n> TCP congestion control is a set of algorithms used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to manage data flow and prevent congestion in a network. It adjusts the rate of data transmission based on network conditions.\n\n### **How do routers help in congestion control?**\n\n> Routers help by managing data packet queues, prioritizing important data, and using algorithms to prevent congestion. They can also send signals to devices to slow down their data transmission if the network is getting overloaded.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-techniques-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Congestion Control techniques in Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-techniques-in-computer-networks/?ref=next_article)\n\nV\n\nVikash Kumar\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n124\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-transport-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an **unreliable and connectionless protocol.** So, there is no need to establish a connection before data transfer.\u00a0The UDP helps to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections over the network. The UDP enables process-to-process communication.\n\n## What is User Datagram Protocol?\n\nUser Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. It is a communication protocol used across the internet for time-sensitive transmissions such as video playback or [DNS lookups](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dns-look-up/) . Unlike Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking, making it a lightweight and efficient option for certain types of data transmission.\n\n![UDP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240226104348/UDP-gif.gif)\n\n## **UDP Header**\n\nUDP header is an **8-byte** fixed and simple header, while for TCP it may vary from 20 bytes to 60 bytes. The first 8 Bytes contain all necessary header information and the remaining part consists of data. UDP port number fields are each 16 bits long, therefore the range for port numbers is defined from 0 to 65535; port number 0 is reserved. Port numbers help to distinguish different user requests or processes.\n\n![UDP-header](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240226104635/UDP-header.jpg)\n\nUDP Header\n\n- **Source Port:** Source Port is a 2 Byte long field used to identify the [port number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ports-in-networking/) of the source.\n- **Destination Port:** It is a 2 Byte long field, used to identify the port of the destined packet.\n- **Length:** Length is the length of UDP including the header and the data. It is a 16-bits field.\n- **Checksum:** Checksum is 2 Bytes long field. It is the 16-bit one\u2019s complement of the one\u2019s complement sum of the UDP header, the pseudo-header of information from the IP header, and the data, padded with zero octets at the end (if necessary) to make a multiple of two octets.\n\n**Notes \u2013** Unlike TCP, the Checksum calculation is not mandatory in UDP. No Error control or flow control is provided by UDP. Hence UDP depends on IP and ICMP for error reporting.\u00a0Also UDP provides port numbers so that is can differentiate between users requests.\n\n## **Applications of UDP**\n\n- Used for simple request-response communication when the size of data is less and hence there is lesser concern about flow and error control.\n- It is a suitable protocol for multicasting as UDP supports packet switching.\n- UDP is used for some routing update protocols like [RIP(Routing Information Protocol).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/)\n- Normally used for real-time applications which can not tolerate uneven delays between sections of a received message.\n- [VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip/) services, such as Skype and WhatsApp, use UDP for real-time voice communication. The delay in voice communication can be noticeable if packets are delayed due to congestion control, so UDP is used to ensure fast and efficient data transmission.\n- [DNS (Domain Name System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) also uses UDP for its query/response messages. DNS queries are typically small and require a quick response time, making UDP a suitable protocol for this application.\n- [DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) uses UDP to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. DHCP messages are typically small, and the delay caused by packet loss or retransmission is generally not critical for this application.\n- Following implementations uses UDP as a transport layer protocol:\n  - NTP (Network Time Protocol)\n  - DNS (Domain Name Service)\n  - BOOTP, DHCP.\n  - NNP (Network News Protocol)\n  - Quote of the day protocol\n  - TFTP, RTSP, RIP.\n- The application layer can do some of the tasks through UDP-\n  - Trace Route\n  - Record Route\n  - Timestamp\n- UDP takes a datagram from [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-services-packetizing-routing-and-forwarding/) , attaches its header, and sends it to the user. So, it works fast.\n\n## TCP vs UDP\n\n| Basis | Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | User Datagram Protocol (UDP) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type of Service | [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection\u00a0orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. | [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is the Datagram-oriented protocol. This is because\u00a0there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission. |\n| Reliability | TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router. | The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. |\n| Error checking mechanism | TCP provides extensive error-checking mechanisms.\u00a0It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. | UDP has only the basic error-checking mechanism using checksums. |\n| Acknowledgme nt | An acknowledgment segment is present. | No acknowledgment segment. |\n| Sequence | Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control\u00a0Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in order at the receiver. | There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If the order is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |\n| Speed | TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. | UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP. |\n| Retransmission | Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. | There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). |\n| Header Length | TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header. | UDP has an 8 bytes fixed-length header. |\n| Weight | TCP is heavy-weight. | UDP is lightweight. |\n| Handshaking Techniques | Uses handshakes such as SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK | It\u2019s a connectionless protocol i.e. No handshake |\n| Broadcasting | TCP doesn\u2019t support Broadcasting. | UDP supports Broadcasting. |\n| Protocols | TCP is used by [HTTP, HTTPs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https-2/) , [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp/) , [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/) and [Telnet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/) . | UDP is used by\u00a0DNS,\u00a0DHCP, TFTP, [SNMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/) ,\u00a0RIP, and\u00a0VoIP. |\n| Stream Type | The TCP connection is a byte stream. | UDP connection is a message stream. |\n| Overhead | Low but higher than UDP. | Very low. |\n| Applications | This protocol is primarily utilized in situations when a safe and trustworthy communication procedure is necessary, such as in email, on the web surfing, and in\u00a0military services. | This protocol is used in situations where quick communication is necessary but where dependability is not a concern, such as VoIP, game streaming, video, and music streaming, etc. |\n\n## **Advantages of UDP**\n\n- **Speed:** UDP is faster than TCP because it does not have the overhead of establishing a connection and ensuring reliable data delivery.\n- Lower latency: Since there is no connection establishment, there is lower latency and faster response time.\n- **Simplicity:** UDP has a simpler protocol design than TCP, making it easier to implement and manage.\n- **Broadcast support:** UDP supports broadcasting to multiple recipients, making it useful for applications such as video streaming and online gaming.\n- **Smaller packet size:** UDP uses smaller packet sizes than TCP, which can reduce network congestion and improve overall network performance.\n- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is more efficient in terms of both latency and bandwidth.\n\n## **Disadvantages of UDP**\n\n- **No reliability:** UDP does not guarantee delivery of packets or order of delivery, which can lead to missing or duplicate data.\n- **No congestion control:** UDP does not have congestion control, which means that it can send packets at a rate that can cause network congestion.\n- **Vulnerable to attacks:** UDP is vulnerable to [denial-of-service attacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deniel-service-prevention/) , where an attacker can flood a network with UDP packets, overwhelming the network and causing it to crash.\n- **Limited use cases:** UDP is not suitable for applications that require reliable data delivery, such as email or file transfers, and is better suited for applications that can tolerate some data loss, such as video streaming or online gaming.\n\n## How is UDP used in DDoS attacks?\n\nA **UDP flood attack** is a type of [**Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ddosdistributed-denial-of-service/) attack where an attacker sends a large number of **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** packets to a target port.\n\n- **UDP Protocol** : Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and doesn\u2019t require a handshake before data transfer. When a UDP packet arrives at a server, it checks the specified port for listening applications. If no app is found, the server sends an [**ICMP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/) **\u201cdestination unreachable\u201d** packet to the supposed sender (usually a random bystander due to spoofed IP addresses).\n- **Attack Process** :\n  - The attacker sends UDP packets with spoofed IP sender addresses to random ports on the target system.\n  - The server checks each incoming packet\u2019s port for a listening application (usually not found due to random port selection).\n  - The server sends ICMP \u201cdestination unreachable\u201d packets to the spoofed sender (random bystanders).\n  - The attacker floods the victim with UDP data packets, overwhelming its resources.\n- **Mitigation** : To protect against UDP flood attacks, monitoring network traffic for sudden spikes and implementing security measures are crucial. Organizations often use specialized tools and services to detect and mitigate such attacks effectively.\n\n## **UDP Pseudo Header**\n\n- The purpose of using a pseudo-header is to verify that the UDP packet has reached its correct destination\n- The correct destination consist of a specific machine and a specific protocol port number within that machine\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230209140709/udp.png)\n\nUDP pseudo header\n\n### **UDP Pseudo Header Details**\n\n- The UDP header itself specify only protocol port number.thus , to verify the destination UDP on the sending machine computes a checksum that covers the destination [IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) as well as the UDP packet.\n- At the ultimate destination, UDP software verifies the checksum using the destination IP address obtained from the header of the IP packet that carried the UDP message.\n- If the [checksum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) agrees, then it must be true that the packet has reached the intended destination host as well as the correct protocol port within that host.\n\n### **User Interface**\n\nA user interface should allow the creation of new receive ports, receive operations on the receive ports that returns the data octets and an indication of source port and source address, and an operation that allows a datagram to be sent, specifying the data, source and destination ports and address to be sent.\n\n### **IP Interface**\n\n- The UDP module must be able to determine the source and destination internet address and the protocol field from internet header\n- One possible UDP/IP interface would return the whole internet datagram including the entire internet header in response to a receive operation\n- Such an interface would also allow the UDP to pass a full internet datagram complete with header to the IP to send. the IP would verify certain fields for consistency and compute the internet header checksum.\n- The IP interface allows the UDP module to interact with the network layer of the protocol stack, which is responsible for routing and delivering data across the network.\n- The IP interface provides a mechanism for the UDP module to communicate with other hosts on the network by providing access to the underlying IP protocol.\n- The IP interface can be used by the UDP module to send and receive data packets over the network, with the help of IP routing and addressing mechanisms.\n\n## GATE Questions for Practice\n\n- [GATE CS 2013, Question 12](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2013-question-12/)\n- [GATE CS 2012, Question 65](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2012-question-22-2/)\n- [GATE CS 2007, Question 20](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2007-question-20/)\n- [GATE CS 2005, Question 23](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2005-question-23/)\n- [GATE IT 2008, Question 66](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-it-2008-question-66/)\n- [GATE Mock 2015, Question 5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-cs-2015-mock-test-question-5/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is an important Transport Layer protocol in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, identified for its speed and efficiency due to its connectionless and lightweight design. While UDP lacks TCP\u2019s stability and error-checking features, it used in applications that need low latency and real-time performance, such as streaming, online gaming, and DNS lookups. Its simplicity and support for broadcast and multicast broadcasts make it a useful tool for specialized applications, despite its vulnerability to data loss and network congestion.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on UDP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Name the protocols that uses UDP?\n\n> The protocol that uses UDP Model are:\n>\n> - [Domain Name System(DNS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/)\n> - [Simple Network Management Protocol(SMTP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/)\n> - [Routing Information Protocol(RIP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/)\n\n### Which is faster: TCP or UDP?\n\n> UDP is faster than TCP.\n\n### Is UDP secure?\n\n> Yes UDP provide various security mechanism.\n\n### Is UDP a layer 3 or 4?\n\n> UDP is layer 4 protocol of [OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-and-ipv4-datagram-header/?ref=next_article)\n\n[IPv4 Datagram Header](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-and-ipv4-datagram-header/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol whereas UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as the UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. In this article, we will discuss the differences between TCP and UDP.\n\n## What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?\n\n[TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It lies between the Application and Network Layers which are used in providing reliable delivery services. It is a connection-oriented protocol for communications that helps in the exchange of messages between different devices over a network. The Internet Protocol (IP), which establishes the technique for sending data packets between computers, works with TCP.\n\n![Transmission Control Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230406111816/TCP-1.png)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol\n\n## Features of TCP\n\n- TCP keeps track of the segments being transmitted or received by assigning numbers to every single one of them.\n- Flow control limits the rate at which a sender transfers data. This is done to ensure reliable delivery.\n- TCP implements an error control mechanism for reliable data transfer.\n- TCP takes into account the level of congestion in the network.\n\n## Applications of TCP\n\n- **World Wide Web (WWW)** : When you browse websites, TCP ensures reliable data transfer between your browser and web servers.\n- **Email** : TCP is used for sending and receiving emails.\u00a0Protocols like **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) handle email delivery across servers.\n- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** : FTP relies on TCP to transfer large files securely.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re uploading or downloading files, TCP ensures data integrity.\n- **Secure Shell (SSH)** : SSH sessions, commonly used for remote administration, rely on TCP for encrypted communication between client and server.\n- **Streaming Media** : Services like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use TCP to stream videos and music.\u00a0It ensures smooth playback by managing data segments and retransmissions.\n\n## Advantages of TCP\n\n- It is reliable for maintaining a connection between Sender and Receiver.\n- It is responsible for sending data in a particular sequence.\n- Its operations are not dependent on [Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) .\n- It allows and supports many routing protocols.\n- It can reduce the speed of data based on the speed of the receiver.\n\n## Disadvantages of TCP\n\n- It is slower than UDP and it takes more bandwidth.\n- Slower upon starting of transfer of a file.\n- Not suitable for [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/) and [PAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-personal-area-network-pan/) Networks.\n- It does not have a multicast or broadcast category.\n- It does not load the whole page if a single data of the page is missing.\n\n## What is User Datagram Protocol (UDP)?\n\n[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is a Transport Layer protocol. UDP is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, referred to as the UDP/IP suite. Unlike TCP, it is an unreliable and connectionless protocol. So, there is no need to establish a connection before data transfer. The UDP helps to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections establish over the network. The UDP enables process-to-process communication.\n\n![User Datagram Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230406112517/TCP-2.png)\n\nUser Datagram Protocol\n\n## Features of UDP\n\n- Used for simple request-response communication when the size of data is less and hence there is lesser concern about flow and error control.\n- It is a suitable protocol for multicasting as UDP supports [packet switching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-switching-and-delays-in-computer-network/) .\n- UDP is used for some routing update protocols like [RIP(Routing Information Protocol)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/) .\n- Normally used for real-time applications which can not tolerate uneven delays between sections of a received message.\n\n## Application of UDP\n\n- **Real-Time Multimedia Streaming** : UDP is ideal for streaming audio and video content.\u00a0Its low-latency nature ensures smooth playback, even if occasional data loss occurs.\n- **Online Gaming** : Many online games rely on UDP for fast communication between players.\n- **DNS (Domain Name System) Queries** : When your device looks up [domain names](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-domain-name/) (like converting \u201cwww.example.com\u201d to an IP address), UDP handles these requests efficiently  .\n- **Network Monitoring** : Tools that monitor network performance often use UDP for lightweight, rapid data exchange.\n- **Multicasting** : UDP supports packet switching, making it suitable for multicasting scenarios where data needs to be sent to multiple recipients simultaneously.\n- **Routing Update Protocols** : Some routing protocols, like RIP (Routing Information Protocol), utilize UDP for exchanging routing information among routers.\n\n## Advantages of UDP\n\n- It does not require any connection for sending or receiving data.\n- [Broadcast and Multicast](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-broadcast-and-multicast/) are available in UDP.\n- UDP can operate on a large range of networks.\n- UDP has live and real-time data.\n- UDP can deliver data if all the components of the data are not complete.\n\n## Disadvantages of UDP\n\n- We can not have any way to acknowledge the successful transfer of data.\n- UDP cannot have the mechanism to track the sequence of data.\n- UDP is connectionless, and due to this, it is unreliable to transfer data.\n- In case of a Collision, UDP packets are dropped by [Routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) in comparison to TCP.\n- UDP can drop packets in case of detection of errors.\n\n## Which Protocol is Better: TCP or UDP?\n\nThe answer to this question is difficult because it totally depends on what work we are doing and what type of data is being delivered. UDP is better in the case of online gaming as it allows us to work lag-free. TCP is better if we are transferring data like photos, videos, etc. because it ensures that data must be correct has to be sent. In general, both TCP and UDP are useful in the context of the work assigned by us. Both have advantages upon the works we are performing, that\u2019s why it is difficult to say, which one is better.\n\n![Difference Between TCP and UDP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230406112559/TCP-3.png)\n\nDifference Between TCP and UDP\n\n### Where TCP is Used?\n\n- Sending Emails\n- Transferring Files\n- Web Browsing\n\n### Where UDP is Used?\n\n- Gaming\n- Video Streaming\n- Online Video Chats\n\n## Differences between TCP and UDP\n\n| Basis | Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | User Datagram Protocol (UDP) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type of Service | [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection\u00a0orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. | [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) is the Datagram-oriented protocol. This is because\u00a0there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast types of network transmission. |\n| Reliability | TCP is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data to the destination router. | The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. |\n| Error checking mechanism | TCP provides extensive [error-checking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-in-computer-networks/) mechanisms.\u00a0It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. | UDP has only the basic error-checking mechanism using [checksums.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-detection-code-checksum/) |\n| Acknowledgment | An acknowledgment segment is present. | No acknowledgment segment. |\n| Sequence | Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control\u00a0Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in order at the receiver. | There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If the order is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |\n| Speed | TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. | UDP is faster, simpler, and more efficient than TCP. |\n| Retransmission | Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. | There is no retransmission of lost packets in the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). |\n| Header Length | TCP has a (20-60) bytes variable length header. | UDP has an 8 bytes fixed-length header. |\n| Weight | TCP is heavy-weight. | UDP is lightweight. |\n| Handshaking Techniques | Uses handshakes such as SYN, ACK, SYN-ACK | It\u2019s a connectionless protocol i.e. No handshake |\n| Broadcasting | TCP doesn\u2019t support Broadcasting. | UDP supports Broadcasting. |\n| Protocols | TCP is used by [HTTP, HTTPs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https-2/) , [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp/) , [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/) and [Telnet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/) . | UDP is used by [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/details-on-dns/) , [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) , TFTP, [SNMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/) , [RIP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-information-protocol-rip/) , and [VoIP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip/) . |\n| Stream Type | The TCP connection is a byte stream. | UDP connection is a message stream. |\n| Overhead | Low but higher than UDP. | Very low. |\n| Applications | This protocol is primarily utilized in situations when a safe and trustworthy communication procedure is necessary, such as in email, on the web surfing, and in\u00a0military services. | This protocol is used in situations where quick communication is necessary but where dependability is not a concern, such as VoIP, game streaming, video, and music streaming, etc. |\n\n**Example:** Suppose there are two houses, H1 and H2, and a letter has to be sent from H1 to H2. But there is a river in between those two houses. Now how can we send the letter?\n\n**Solution 1:** Make a bridge over the river and then it can be delivered.\n\n**Solution 2:** Get it delivered by a pigeon.\n\n- Consider the first solution as **TCP** . A connection has to be made (bridge) to get the data (letter) delivered.\u00a0The data is reliable because it will directly reach another end without loss of data or error.\n- The second solution is **UDP** . No connection is required for sending the data. The process is fast as compared to TCP, where we need to set up a connection(bridge). But the data is not reliable: we don\u2019t know whether the pigeon will go in the right direction, will drop the letter on the way, or some issue is encountered mid-travel.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo summarise, TCP and UDP are both important [Transport Layer protocols](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-protocols/) with distinct properties and uses. TCP offers dependable, orderly, and error-free data transmission, making it ideal for operations that require precision, such as file transfers and web browsing. UDP, on the other hand, provides quicker, connectionless communication that is excellent for real-time applications such as gaming and video streaming, when speed is critical and minor data loss is acceptable. The exact requirements of the task at hand determine whether TCP or UDP should be used.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on TCP and UDP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Which is faster: TCP or UDP?**\n\n> UDP is faster than TCP.

SCTP is a transport layer of Internet Protocol (IP).\n\n> SCTP support telephone connection over the internet.\n\n## **History of SCTP Protocol**\n\nSCTP is a standard protocol that was coined by The Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The reason for the development of the protocol is to develop a system that is similar to the telephone Signaling System 7 (SS7) switching network for carrying call control signals using networks.\n\n![SCTP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231201202518/Screenshot-2023-12-01-202359.png)TSVWG and IETF developed SCTP as a standard protocol\n\nThe SCTP is similar to TCP protocol but the advantage is that it also provides message oriented data transfer like User Datagram Protocol (UDP) which makes it useful for end to end communication over internet. Both TCP and UPD protocol are based on the concept that made SCTP possible. Unlike TCP SCTP make ensure that it complete the concurrent transmission over several streams of data in units called message between the end points which are connected to each other.\n\n## Understanding Stream Control Transmission Protocol\n\nAs we know SCTP is an transport layer protocol it exist at an equivalent level with UDP and TCP which provides the transport layer functions properties to many other Internet applications. As it is a reliable transport protocol which operates on top of connectionless packet networks like IP and supports transfer of data over the network in single or multiple Ip cases.\n\nIt transport the signaling message to and from Signaling System (SS7) for 3G mobiles networks with help of M3UA, M2Ua or SUA. It is a packet based transport protocol. It is both reliable and secure transport which minimize the end to end delay.\n\nThis protocol is optimized to :-\n\n- It avoids problem related to he multithread infrastructure during the high traffic.\n- It also improves the SCTP association searching rate by SCTP hash table optimization on the SPU(Services Processing Unit ).\n- It improves the FSM for retransmission of cases.\n\n## What is Multihoming in SCTP?\n\nFirst we will understand multihoming so multihoming is the process of connecting a network or a host to multiple network simultaneously which is done due to increase reliability or performance.\n\nTelecommunication systems are highly prone to time delays. Multihoming system enables with multiple interfaces to use one over the other without waiting. SCTP multihoming means that the endpoints which are connected can have different IP addresses associated to it. In simpler way multihoming refers to sending data to an alternate IP address if in case due to any issue the primary or original IP address is unreachable. Therefore the SCTP can connect or establish multiple connection paths between two endpoints.\n\nIn this there is a original or primary interface or secondary interfaces. So during establishment of connections a acknowledgment process validates the IP address and manages the round trip time (RTT) for each individual address. The RTT calculation enables the communication to migrate to a secondary interface.\n\n## SCTP Packet\n\nSCTP protocol packet consist of two main parts Header and Payload. The Header is common but Payload have variable chunks.\n\nThe Common SCTP header is 12 byte long and made of the 4 parts\n\n- **Port Number (Source):** shows the sending port\n- **Port Number (Destination):** shows the receiving port\n- **Verification tag:** a 32 bit random value which differentiate the packets from the previous connection\n- **Checksum:** a CRC32 algorithm for detection of error.\n\n![SCTP Packet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231202103329/Screenshot-2023-12-02-102919.png)SCTP Packet\n\n## Security\n\nThis protocol provides certain security features related to transport such as resistance against blind DOS attack (Denial of Service), masquerades and monopolization of any type of service during operation. SIGTRAN (Signaling Transport) protocols does not define any type of new security mechanism as current available security protocols provide necessary steps for securing the transmission of SS7 message over IP networks\n\n### SCTP Services\n\n- Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP)\n- Bearer-independent Call Control (BICC)\n- Direct Data Placement Segment chunk (DDP-segment)\n- Direct Data Placement Stream session control (DDP-stream)\n- Diameter in a DTLS/SCTP DATA chunk (Diameter-DTLS)\n\n## Understanding Central Point Architecture Support for SCTP\n\nAs we know that the SCTP association is a connection between two SCTP endpoints. Each endpoint identifies it's association with a tag. During it's setup the SCTP endpoints exchange their tags for receiving packets. So during the exchange f packets between two SCTP endpoints the both source and destination address can change in the association life cycle.\n\nBefore the release of Junos OS 15.1X49-D40 all the sessions of the SCTP association are hashed to the same SPU with the help of the fixed per association SCTP port pair. In many of the cases multiple SCTP association use the same port pair, which results a bad load balancing with all the traffic handled by single SPU. When the version Junos OS release 15.1X49-D40 and Junos OS Release 17.3R1 to handle load balancing issue, the tag based hash distribution is used to ensure the even distribution of the traffic of SCTP from various associations among all the SPU's. It's flow session utilizes a connection tag to more finely distribute SCTP traffic across all the SPU's on the SRX1500, SRX4100, SRX4200, SRX5400, SRX600, and SRX800 devices that supports the SCTP ALG. The decoding of connection tag is from SCTP vtag.\n\n## Advantages of SCTP\n\nAs SCTP is a full duplex connection, it enables the data to be sent and receive simultaneously. The data is delivered in chunks and in a ordered way which are independent to each stream this help in isolating the data from other streams.\n\nLike TCP and unlike UDP the SCTP provides the following advantage\n\n- **Flow control:** It adjust the data transmission in a particular order and quantity.\n- **Congestion control:** It checks for network prior transmission to prevent the congestion over the links.\n- **Fault tolerance:** It uses the IP address from different internet services providers. So, if in case ISP fails another connection can be used for establishing the connection.\n- It is a message oriented rather than byte oriented as of UDP.\n- It provides a path selection functionality to select the primary data transmission and a monitoring function to test the connectivity of transmission path.\n\n## Limitation and Constraints of SCTP Protocol\n\n- **IP address**\n  - In this protocol a maximum of eight IP address and eight destination IP address are used in communication.\n  - In this only static IP NAT is supported.\n- **SCTP Payload Protocol Blocking**\n  - If there is any change in the protocol blocking configuration it immediately impacts the traffic of existing associations.\n  - The protocol which is supported is in decimal value ranging from 0 to 63, which includes 48 IANA protocol and 16 unassigned protocols.\n- All the static NAT the interfaces packets (client or server side) should belong from the same zone.\n- The sessions of SCTP are not deleted with associations they have a time out of 30 min (default).\n- Only the Static NAT is supported for SCTP protocol.\n\n## Application Of SCTP Protocol\n\n- **Telephone Communication:** It was developed foe the communication of telephony over the internet.\n- **Multihoming Support:** It provides multihoming support, in which both endpoints of the connection can have multiple IP address which help helps in detection of failure in between the communication path.\n- Transport for various Application: It is used in transport signaling messages to and from SS7(Signaling System 7) on the devices supporting 3G networks through M3UA , M2UA.\n- **Roaming Security and RAN Security:** In mobile infrastructure it is used in roaming security and RAN (Radio Access Network) security.\n- Reliable and Secure Transport: This protocol provides reliable and highly secure transport or communication which minimizes the end to end delay.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nStream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a connection oriented protocol which allows transmission of multiple data streams. SCTP was first coined by the Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to create a system similar to the telephone Signaling System 7 (SS7) switching network for carrying call control signals using IP networks. SCTP make sure that it completes transmission of several streams of data in units called messages between the connected endpoints. It supports the multihoming concept, , which increases the reliability and performance. it is a reliable and very secure and trustworthy transport protocol which minimizes end to end delay and provides security features like, resistance against blind DOS attacks, masquerades, and monopolization of services during operation. It is used in various applications such as Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP), Bearer-independent Call Control (BICC), and others. It's advantages include full duplex connection, message oriented data transfer, flow control, congestion control, and fault tolerance. It has limitations of a maximum of eight IP addresses and the eight destination IP addresses in the communication process, and it only supports static IP NAT . Changes in the protocol blocking configuration immediately, it impacts the traffic.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### 1\\.

Congestion can be caused by several reasons: either the routers which are being used are not fast enough, the CPUs which are being used are not fast enough and they do not manage to quit queues in OS in a timely manner, buffers are not large enough as our requirements or they are lost from the packets. Also in the case of very high traffic, the situation can be worse enough that no packages are delivered at all.\n\n**DCCP** is basically a message-based transport-level protocol. The setting of a secure connection is easily maintained using it, its closure i.e. ECN ( [Explicit Congestion Notification](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ecnexplicit-congestion-notification/)), [congestion control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-in-computer-networks/), and negotiation of features. DCCP is a great technique to access congestion control mechanisms, also we don\u2019t need to implement them at the application level also.\n\nDCCP basically allows similar Transfer Control Protocol feeds also, but delivery in the order of transmission cannot be done. Sequential delivery of multiple streams (as in SCTP- [Stream Control Transmission Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sctp-full-form/)) is not available in DCCP.\n\nDCCP is widely used in applications package delivery is composed of time constraints. The examples that come under this category include multiplayer online games, internet telephony, streaming media (video, audio), etc. The most important feature of these applications is that old messages quickly become expired automatically, lose their usefulness by default.\n\nDCCP connection setup can be explained through the below image, it is basically similar to TCP connection setup :\n\n![DCCP Connection setup](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220315154712/dccp3.jpg)\n\nDCCP Connection setup\n\nOn the other hand, the higher priority is given to new messages, so to resend the packets is not very much useful here, it would eventually consume time and unnecessary network resources as well. Datagram Congestion Control Protocol can also be used as a general congestion control technique for those types of applications that are based on the UDP protocol as well. A safety mechanism can also be added and possibly one for packet delivery in the order of transmission. In other cases, DCCP helps to use various congestion control mechanisms, generally Transmission Control Protocol-friendly. Confirmation traffic and data traffic are both contained in a DCCP connection.\n\nThe transmitter gets to know with the help of confirmations that his packages have arrived at the destination or have been marked by ECN. Confirmations are used with the purpose of safety demanded by the congestion control mechanism. Its primary aim is to reach 100% safely.\n\n### DCCP Packet structure:\n\nThe DCCP generic header has various forms according to the value given to X i.e. the Extended Sequence Numbers bit.\n\nLet X = 1,\n\nthe Sequence Number field is 48 bits long, and the generic header takes 16 bytes, which is clearly explained in the below image.\n\n![DCCP generic header when X=1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220315154031/DCCp-660x298.jpg)\n\nDCCP generic header when X=1\n\nIf we change the value of X = 0, only the low 24 bits of the Sequence Number are transmitted, and the generic header is 12 bytes long which is shown in the below image :\n\n![DCCP generic header when X=0](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220315154325/dccp2-660x240.jpg)\n\nDCCP generic header when X=0\n\n### Features of DCCP:\n\n01. DCCP is a non-reliable datagram stream, with a good feature of confirmation.\n02. DCCP helps to secure negotiation of options, including negotiation of the most suitable mechanism for congestion control.\n03. It provides a secure handshake protocol with the purpose of initializing and closing the connection of DCCP.\n04. It plays a vital role in the discovery of the maximum transmitting unit on the chosen path by the user.\n05. It provides techniques that allow servers to avoid storing states for attempted unconnected, unconfirmed disconnections, or for already closed connections as well.\n06. Confirmation mechanisms are a very good feature of DCCP which helps to communicate packet loss and ECN information.\n07. Optional mechanisms are also some good techniques that communicate to the emitting application with high security, which packets have reached the receiver and which are not, also whether they have been marked by ECN or not, or they are corrupted or removed in the receiver buffer.\n08. DCCP can support multiple concurrent streams within a single connection, which enables applications to transmit multiple data flows over the same connection.\n09. It provides a mechanism for applications to prioritize their data flows, which helps in achieving better Quality of Service (QoS).\n10. DCCP supports both connection-oriented and connectionless communication modes.\n11. It offers a congestion control mechanism that is more flexible than the TCP congestion control mechanism.\n12. DCCP can be used over both IP version 4 and IP version 6 networks.\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n- **Congestion control:** Unlike UDP, which has no built-in mechanism for controlling congestion, DCCP includes congestion control algorithms that help to prevent network overload and ensure reliable delivery of data.\n- **Quality of Service (QoS) support:** DCCP provides support for QoS, which allows network administrators to prioritize different types of traffic based on their importance. This can be useful for applications such as video streaming or voice over IP, where low latency and high reliability are essential.\n- **Flexibility:** DCCP is designed to be a flexible protocol, allowing network administrators to choose from a variety of congestion control algorithms based on the specific requirements of their network and applications.\n- **Compatibility:** DCCP is designed to work with existing IP networks and is compatible with traditional IP protocols like TCP and UDP.\n\n### **Real-World Applications**\n\n- **Streaming media:** DCCP is often used in streaming media applications, such as video conferencing, where low latency and high reliability are important. The congestion control algorithms built into DCCP help to ensure that these applications can run smoothly and effectively, even in networks with high levels of congestion.\n- **Gaming:** Some online gaming applications also make use of DCCP, as its congestion control algorithms can help to prevent network slowdowns and ensure that game data is delivered quickly and reliably.\n- **Telemetry:** DCCP is also used in telemetry applications, where large amounts of data need to be transmitted from remote devices back to a central control center. The congestion control algorithms built into DCCP help to ensure that this data is delivered reliably and efficiently, even in congested networks.\n- **Remote Access:** DCCP can be used for remote access applications, as it provides a reliable and secure connection for remote access to servers and other resources.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-in-datagram-subnets/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Congestion Control in Datagram Subnets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/congestion-control-in-datagram-subnets/?ref=next_article)\n\n[V](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/vipul1501/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[vipul1501](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/vipul1501/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n3\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks-Premier-League-2022](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2022/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol)?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCongestion in a network means deterioration of network or services which are caused due to overloading of network nodes, basically, this problem is primarily associated with large networks, in which a large amount of data and information is being transmitted.

UDP is used as a highly time-sensitive communicative protocol. R in RUDP stands for Reliable, it is a UDP-based data transfer but with higher Reliability. It provides reliability by using the sliding window protocol. RUDP is basically the solution to the UDP where data reliability along with confirmation is needed.\n\nAs UDP provides unreliable data transfer protocol which is unreliable services of things and the worst it sometimes goes missing without notice. Reliable UDP uses both positive and negative feedback to provide data reliability which provides reliable data transfer.\n\nIn UDP sender\u2019s simply send a message without a piece of prior information about the receiver\u2019s availability which results in a faster rate but it can result in the loss of some packages, also the receiver can receive duplicate packets and UDP also does not provide information that the package has been received or not. RUDP used a sliding window protocol that delivers or transfers the datagram with reliability.\n\n### RUDP Architecture\n\nThe sending process and receiving process of the architecture both stand in the application layer. The sender server sends the data packets to the receiving channel using RUDP protocol; a window size is maintained by both the sender and the receiver, the window consists of some predefined value tending to maximum avoiding the communication errors taking all the edge cases where the packets can be dropped.\n\n![RUDP Protocol Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220418103457/Rudpprotocolarchitecture.jpg)\n\nRUDP Protocol Architecture\n\n### Implementation of RUDP protocol:\n\nUse synchronized shared buffers using counting semaphores so that only one thread access the buffer at a time to prevent the deadlock situation from occurring.\n\nLet\u2019s keep two-variable called as the base and next to keep the track of the window functioning. If the sender sent\u2019s the packet, the variable next is incremented to 1, this is the way of calculating the number of packets in the buffer.\n\nThe timeouts are handled using the timers which are scheduled immediately after sending the packet over the channel, simulate the packet loss rate and random network delay in the protocol.\n\npackets are kept in a queue and assigned a value that values the system\u2019s current time plus the network delay. When the current time of the system is associated with the assigned value the packet is freed from the queue and sent over the network. While the packet is sent over the network it gives an (ACK) acknowledgment. When the ack matches with the sequence number senders send another packet assigning it with the consecutive number.\n\n### Classes in RUDP Protocol:\n\nFollowing are the classes that are used to implement the RUDP protocol:\n\n- **RUDP:** This contains the send() and receives () functions called by the client and server.\n- **Buffer\\_RUDP:** contains the implementation shared buffer using counting semaphores.\n- **Receiver\\_Thread**: Implements a threaded architecture that simultaneously waits for the packets in the sockets while sending and receiving the data and waits to process the incoming data.\n- **Segment\\_RUDP:** defines the structure of RUDP packets.\n- **Timeout\\_Handler:** to handle the timeouts\n- **Support\\_RUDP:** provides functions like send\\_UDP();\n- **Client:** It sends the data.\n- **Server:** It receives the data.\n\n**Sliding Window Protocol:**\n\n[Sliding window protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-protocol-set-1/) also known as RUDP\u2019s SWP on which RUDP is based, is used where the reliability comes into play and it is very much essential or for security reasons where the knowledge of data transferred along with confirmation is required. It works in segments which means it divides the provided data into segments then packets or data packets are prepared and sent over the network, resulting in when the receiver receives the package it checks the order of the packets and discards duplicates and after that, is sent it sends the acknowledgment to the sender for the correctly received packets.\n\n**There are 3 Sliding window Protocols:**\n\n- One Bit Sliding Window Protocol\n- Go back to N protocol\n- Selective Repeat Protocol\n\n**Piggy-backing Technique:**\n\nSliding window Protocol uses the [piggy-backing technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piggybacking-in-computer-networks/), the technique is based on the acknowledgment that is received but, how is received? So, the answer is it provides the sliding window protocol to attach the acknowledgment in the next frame so that when a receiver receives the data it maintains a set of sequence numbers which is corresponding to the frames that are also can be called acknowledgment frames within a window portion of same or different sizes.\n\n**The mathematics of frame calculation:**\n\nWhen a new packet is sent by the sender to the receiver it is given the highest packet sequence mark and the window\u2019s upper edge is incremented with one for the acknowledged frames and vice versa for the unacknowledged frames. That calculates the mark of unacknowledged frames as well as acknowledged frames and when this number comes to zero that means all the packets have been delivered successfully and it provides feedback to the sender. It is used in data-intensive applications that require a lot of work in a very less amount of time over high-speed networks, where reliability plays a very important role.\n\n### Server-Side Code Architecture:\n\n- Client Class sets the rate of loss and sends the data to the RUDP class, where window sizes of both the sender and receiver are set in the class.\n- The RUDP class as per the working divides the data into segments of equal sizes and hence assigns the frames i.e. sequence number and checksum to each segment separately then put it in the sender\u2019s window if it has any available slot.\n- Support\\_RUDP comes into play now, when the data packets in segments are sent by the sender this class collects and prepares the packets from the segments and sends them over the unreliable channel. Once it is sent the timer goes on immediately.\n- Thread\\_receiver class is the important class for the RUDP structure it provides a thread along with the thread of the data it parallelly sends a thread with the data and waits on the socket for the incoming data, when it receives the packet from the socket it makes a segment and verifies the checksum, if the checksum clarifies it is the sent data then it checks for the acknowledgment if the acknowledgment received then it removes the packet from sender\u2019s window and sent it over the socket; if a timeout happens and a packet is lost it resends the packet and restart the timer immediately, If the RUDP class receives the packet before the timeout then it cancels the timer.\n\n![Server-Side Code Architecture:](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220421094516/sendersideRUDP.jpg)\n\nServer-Side Code Architecture:\n\n### Receiver Side Code Architecture:\n\n- Thread\\_receiver Class that implemented a thread parallel runs with the thread of the sent data and one of the instances waits at the socket to continue to process the data that is coming. Once the class receives the packet is verified with the segment and made a segment from it and matches with the checksum. If the segment contains the required data then it sends an acknowledgment and puts it in the Buffer\\_receiver class and if the packet is not there then it stores all following the lost into the Buffer\\_receiver.\n- Once the lost packet is received it processes all and then the RUDP class delivers all the packets reordering correctly once it was buffered to the server.\n- Once the confirmation is provided that all the data have been received then the connection is closed.\n\n![Receiver Side Code Architecture:](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220421094637/recieversideRUDP.jpg)\n\nReceiver Side Code Architecture:\n\n### PseudoCode for RUDP Class:\n\n```\nClass RUDP{\n//setting up the window sizes\nset Receiver Window size\nset Sender Window size\nstart receiver thread that receives the aka(Acknowledgment) and data for both the receiver and the sender\n//sender calls\nsent_data(byte[] data_gram, int size)\n{\n     //process flow => data -> segments -> store into sender buffer -> send -> start timer\n     //breaking into segments and sending along with frames\n     Divide into the segments.\n     put every segment into the sender's buffer\n     segment sending using sent_udp() of support_RUDP class\n     timeout scheduling for the data that is divided into segments using frames\n}\n//receiver calls\nreceive_data(byte[] buffer, int size)\n{\n     //receiving of the segments of the data packets\n     segment receiving once at a time including the frames\n}\n//call by both the sender and receiver\nclose()\n{\n     //creation of flag for the indication\n     creation of a flag segment to indicate the data transfer status\n     //verification of the data\n     //if data receiving completed -> close\n     once the complete data is received close the segment\n}\n}\n//RUDP class ends here\n```\n\n### Pseudo Code of Thread\\_receiver class:\n\n```\nClass Thread_receiver\n{\nwhile(true)\n    {\n         //waiting for the packet -> received\n         Receive the packet from socket\n         //numberize or make checksum of the data\n        individualize a segment from the packet that is received\n         //verification of the data\n         checksum verification that is sent along the frames\n         if segment contains acknowledgment\n          process -> remove segments from the sender's buffer\n         if segment contains data\n          put data->receiver's buffer\n          send acknowledgment\n    }\n}\n//end of Thread_receiver Class\n```\n\n### Pseudo Code for Support\\_RUDP class:\n\n```\nClass Support_RUDP\n{\n    //simulate over the conditions that can cause the segments not received completely\n    random network delay\n    network loss\n    any other potential that can effect the packet\n    //process\n    packets from the segments received processing\n    //sent\n    sent the data packet over the socket\n}\n//end of Support_RUDP class\n\nPseudo Code for Client-Server Class\n//Sender\nClass Client{\n    RUDP rudp = new RUDP(Host_name, Port, Local);\n    //send the data\n    rudp.send();\n    //close\n    rudp.close();\n}\n//client class end\n//Receiver Class start\nClass Server{\n    RUDP rudp = new RUDP(Host_name, Port, Local);\n    //receive the data\n    rudp.receive();\n    //close\n    rudp.close();\n}\n```\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/soubhikmitra98/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[soubhikmitra98](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/soubhikmitra98/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nRUDP stands for Reliable user datagram protocol, whereas UDP is one of the core members of IP i.e internet protocol suite.

Without delving into its history, we will see the working & usage of the QUIC.\n\n## Prerequisite\n\n- [OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) or [TCP/IP Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/)\n- [HTTP Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-http-using-browsers/)\n\n## Where QUIC is used?\n\nQUIC, commonly known as HTTP/3, which is Version 3 of HTTP-based communication. We all know that HTTP Protocol is used in web technology to request data from the remote web server & present the data in the browser. The data may be anything such as images, text, video, audio, etc., HTTP will fetch those data from the server & present it in the visualized format in the browser.\n\nUpto HTTP/2, it uses [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) in the transport layer. We are all aware that TCP is Connection-oriented & reliable.\n\nThe drawback of TCP is its latency which is it took 3 Round trips and sometimes more round trips are needed. Such as SYN(Client -> Server), SYNACK(Server -> Client), and ACK(Client ->Server), If it is SSL Trusted communication(HTTPS), One more round trip is needed to check the Certificate validation. So. this round trip, makes the latency in the single request.\n\nSo, the QUIC evolved which works in the transport layer and uses the UDP Protocol. Due to the nature of UDP, which is fast and furious, QUIC provides lesser latency and faster response than TCP. QUIC is used along with HTTP Protocol to provide faster response to the end-user.\n\n## QUIC - the replacement of TCP + TLS\n\nHTTP works in the application layer and uses the TCP as its backend to communicate with the web server with its Handshaking mechanism. If TLS-enabled communication is enabled, then it will do the additional process to ensure that HTTPS Connection is secure & it's a valid certificate from a third party.\n\nIn QUIC, it doesn't do this round trips to each SYN, SYNACK, ACK, and SSL Verification in separate requests to the server. Instead of in the first request itself, it gets to know about the Server Security Information & as it is using UDP in its transport layer, no more connection establishment is needed that UDP is a connectionless protocol\n\nIn simple, we can say that\n\n```\nHTTP/2  = TCP (SYN, SYNACK, ACK) + TLS\nHTTP/3 = QUIC\n\n```\n\nWhich will remove the latency of those 2 processes in their first single request itself.\n\n## UDP Usage in QUIC\n\nQUIC Protocol is running on the top of UDP. UDP is connection less & unreliable in data transmission. TCP standard is fame due to its reliablity. QUIC just extends the UDP as reliable connection provider here with some advanced techniques. So, due its fastness and reliable communication, the communication between the Client-server is both fasty and reliable. So, less data loss is there.\n\nAlong with that, due to its running on existing technology UDP, no more additional adoption is needed in the existing web technology world. most of the technology supports UDP. This is thing that adds more weight to the QUIC Protocol.\n\n## Steps to unable QUIC in the Browser\n\nNow a days, by default QUIC Protocol is enabled in the recent versions of chromium based browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Chromium Edge, Vivaldi, So if the site supports HTTP/3 website, the request took the HTTP/3 based protocol.\n\n### Using chromium experiments:\n\n- Open the Browser\n- Go to chrome://flags\n- Search for QUIC\n- There you can have option to Enable or disable to QUIC.\n\n### Using command line option:\n\n- <browser.exe> enable-quic --quic-version=h3-25\n\n```\nEg: chrome.exe enable-quic --quic-version=h3-25\n\n```\n\n### Enterprise Policy or registry:\n\n- This Policy will help to allow/block QUIC protocol in Enterprise level\n- **Registry Key:** \\[HKLM/HKCU\\]/SOFTWARE/Policies/Google/Chrome\n- **QuicAllowed(REG-DWORD):** 1(Allowed) or 0(Blocked)\n\n## Steps to see uses of QUIC for its communication in web Browser\n\n- Open Browser\n- In a new tab, open the devoper tools -> Network tab\n- Search for site (www.google.com)\n- Right Click the row header(Name, Status, ..), there you can find the header named Protocol -> choose it\n- If its **http3** or **h3,** then it is using the QUIC Protocol for its communication.\n\n### View of Browser:\n\n![protoco_ref-min-min](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240212230434/protoco_ref-min-min.png)Protocol Shows H3 - QUIC Protocol\n\n### QUIC took lesser time than TCP:\n\nAs we mentioned above, QUIC Took lesser time than TCP, to do this experiment, load the site www.google.com in H2 protocol & refer the latency time, then run in H3 Protocol and refer their latency. Then we can conclude the latency difference between H2 and H3.\n\n#### QUIC's time:\n\n![h3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240212232323/h3.png)H3 time taken\n\n#### TCP time:\n\nwe can see that time taken by H2 (TCP/IP) = 284 ms where as time taken by H3 (QUIC) is 261 ms.\n\n![h2-new](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240212232430/h2-new.png)H2 time taken\n\n## Pros of QUIC Protocol\n\n- Due to its running based on UDP, no such overwhelming adoption is needed.\n- Reliablity based UDP makes the connection faster.\n- Security mechanism is handled based on existing TLS mechanism.\n\n## Cons of QUIC Protocol\n\n- As it is a new protocol so, not all browser support it yet. This can leeds to compatibility issue.\n- This protocol is not based on traditional TCP so it may not support all the debugging tools, that will make a challage to Network administrator.\n- Flow control mechanism needs to be handled properly.\n- It's congestion control mechanism is different from TCP that shows different behaviour in terms of Congestion-aware.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xmpp-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[XMPP Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xmpp-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rasisilambu9/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[rasisilambu9](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/rasisilambu9/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Web Technologies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/?ref=article_category)\n- [JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/javascript/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[QUIC Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nWhat is QUIC Protocol?As we know Protocol is a rule regarding how the data is communicated, how the data is transferred between two mediums, encryption standards, etc., QUIC Protocol is the same that was developed by Google INC. in the year 2012 and owned by itself.

The application layer provides the functionality to send and receive data from users. It acts as the interface between the user and the application. The application provides services like file transmission, mail service, and many more.\n\n![1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127103912860245/1.webp)\n\nApplication Layer in OSI Model\n\n## **Functions of Application Layer**\n\nThe Application Layer, being topmost layer in OSI model, performs functions required in any kind of application or communication process. Let\u2019s have a look into the functions:\n\n![functions_of_application_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953020973/functions_of_application_layer.webp)![functions_of_application_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953020973/functions_of_application_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_application_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953259838/functions_of_application_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_application_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953259838/functions_of_application_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_application_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953440867/functions_of_application_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_application_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953440867/functions_of_application_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_application_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953641620/functions_of_application_layer_3.webp)![functions_of_application_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953641620/functions_of_application_layer_3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_application_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953876476/functions_of_application_layer_4.webp)![functions_of_application_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127123953876476/functions_of_application_layer_4.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 5\n\n## **Working of Application Layer**\n\n- At first, client sends a command to server and when server receives that command, it allocates port number to client.\n- Thereafter, the client sends an initiation connection request to server and when server receives request, it gives acknowledgement (ACK) to client through client has successfully established a connection with the server.\n- Therefore, now client has access to server through which it may either ask server to send any types of files or other documents or it may upload some files or documents on server itself.\n\n## **Services Provided by Application Layer Protocols**\n\nThe following are some of the services which are provided by Application layer protocols-\n\n- The Application Layer protocol defines process for both parties which are involved in communication.\n- These protocols define the type of message being sent or received from any side (either source host or destination host).\n- These protocols also define basic syntax of the message being forwarded or retrieved.\n- These protocols define the way to send a message and the expected response.\n- These protocols also define interaction with the next level.\n\nRead in detail about [Services Provided by Application Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-services).\n\n## Protocols of the Application Layer\n\nThe application layer provides several protocols which allow any software to easily send and receive information and present meaningful data to its users. The following are some of the application layer protocols.\n\n- **HTTP:** [**HTTP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web (WWW). HTTP works on the client server model. This protocol is used for transmitting hypermedia documents like HTML. This protocol was designed particularly for the communications between the web browsers and web servers, but this protocol can also be used for several other purposes. HTTP is a stateless protocol (network protocol in which a client sends requests to server and server responses back as per the given state), which means the server is not responsible for maintaining the previous client\u2019s requests. HTTP uses port number 80.\n- **DNS:** [**DNS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/) stands for Domain Name System. The DNS service translates the domain name (selected by user) into the corresponding IP address. For example- If you choose the domain name as www.abcd.com, then DNS must translate it as 192.36.20.8 (random IP address written just for understanding purposes). DNS protocol uses the port number 53.\n- **TELNET:** [Telnet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/) stands for Telecommunications Network. This protocol is used for managing files over the Internet. It allows the Telnet clients to access the resources of Telnet server.

These records are stored in a tree-like structure.\n- **Namespace:** Set of possible names, flat or hierarchical. The naming system maintains a collection of bindings of names to values \u2013 given a name, a resolution mechanism returns the corresponding value.\n- **Name Server:** It is an implementation of the resolution mechanism.\n\n> DNS = Name service in Internet \u2013 A zone is an administrative unit, and a domain is a subtree.\n\n## **Types of Domain**\n\nThere are various kinds of domains:\n\n- **Generic Domains:** .com(commercial), .edu(educational), .mil(military), .org(nonprofit organization), .net(similar to commercial) all these are generic domains.\n- **Country Domain:** .in (India) .us .uk\n- **Inverse Domain:** if we want to know what is the domain name of the website. IP to domain name mapping. So DNS can provide both the mapping for example to find the IP addresses of geeksforgeeks.org then we have to type\n\n> nslookup **www.geeksforgeeks.org**\n\n![Types of DNS](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230319113854/Types-of-DNS.png)\n\nTypes of DNS\n\n## **Domain Name Server**\n\nThe client machine sends a request to the local name server, which, if the root does not find the address in its database, sends a request to the root name server, which in turn, will route the query to a top-level domain (TLD) or authoritative name server. The root name server can also contain some **hostName** to IP address mappings. The Top-level domain (TLD) server always knows who the authoritative name server is. So finally the IP address is returned to the local name server which in turn returns the IP address to the host.\n\n![Domain Name Server](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2017/02/DNS_3.png)\n\nDomain Name Server\n\n## DNS Lookup\n\n[DNS Lookup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dns-look-up/), also called DNS Resolution, is the process of translating a human-readable domain name (like www.example.com) into its corresponding IP address (like 192.0.2.1), which computers use to locate and communicate with each other on the internet. It allows users to access websites easily using names instead of remembering numeric IP addresses.\n\n- DNS Lookup starts when a user types a domain name into their browser.\n- The query goes through a series of servers: the DNS resolver, Root server, TLD server, and authoritative server.\n- Each server plays a role in finding the correct IP address for the domain.\n- Once the IP address is found, the browser connects to the website\u2019s server and loads the page.\n\n## DNS Resolver\n\n[DNS Resolver](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/address-resolution-in-dns-domain-name-server/) is simply called a DNS Client and has the functionality for initiating the process of DNS Lookup which is also called DNS Resolution. By using the DNS Resolver, applications can easily access different websites and services present on the Internet by using domain names that are very much friendly to the user and that also resolves the problem of remembering IP Address.\n\n### Types of DNS Queries\n\nThere are basically three types of DNS Queries that occur in DNS Lookup. These are stated below.\n\n- **Recursive Query:** In this query, if the resolver is unable to find the record, in that case, DNS client wants the DNS Server will respond to the client in any way like with the requested source record or an error message.\n- **Iterative Query:** Iterative Query is the query in which DNS Client wants the best answer possible from the DNS Server.\n- **Non-Recursive Query:** Non-Recursive Query is the query that occurs when a DNS Resolver queries a DNS Server for some record that has access to it because of the record that exists in its cache.\n\n## DNS Caching\n\n[DNS Caching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dns-spoofing-or-dns-cache-poisoning/) can be simply termed as the process used by DNS Resolvers for storing the previously resolved information of DNS that contains domain names, and IP Addresses for some time. The main principle of DNS Caching is to speed up the process of future DNS lookup and also help in reducing the overall time of DNS Resolution.\n\n- **Speeds Up Access**: It stores previous website lookups, so your device can quickly load frequently visited sites without asking the network for the IP address each time.\n- **Reduces Internet Traffic**: This storage cuts down on the number of requests sent across the internet, helping reduce overall network congestion.\n- **Enhances User Experience**: With faster loading times for websites and less waiting, browsing the internet becomes a smoother, more enjoyable experience.\n\n## Domain Name System (DNS) \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What do you mean by level 3 DNS Server?\n\n> Level 3 can be termed as a third-party DNS Server that is completely free and open to the public.\n\n### Is Domain Name System (DNS) a protocol?\n\n> Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that is used to convert easily readable names for communicating over the network, instead of remembering IP Address.\n\n### How can you categorize a DNS as a TCP or UDP?\n\n> DNS is designed to be used in both the ways like as a TCP or as a UDP. It converts to TCP when it is not able to communicate on UDP.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/details-on-dns/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Records in DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/details-on-dns/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n183\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Application Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-application-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

The WWW was started by CERN in 1989.\u00a0 WWW is defined as the collection of different websites around the world, containing different information shared via local servers(or computers).\n\nWeb pages are linked together using hyperlinks which are HTML-formatted and, also referred to as hypertext, these are the fundamental units of the Internet and are accessed through [Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/). Such digital connections, or links, allow users to easily access desired information by connecting relevant pieces of information. The benefit of hypertext is it allows you to pick a word or phrase from the text and click on other sites that have more information about it. This data may be presented in text, picture, audio, or video formats on the internet.\n\n## **History of the WWW**\n\nIt is a project created, by Tim Berner Lee in 1989, for researchers to work together effectively at CERN. It is an organization, named the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/w3c-full-form/), which was developed for further development of the web. This organization is directed by Tim Berner\u2019s Lee, aka the father of the web.\u00a0 CERN, where Tim Berners worked, is a community of more than 1700 researchers from more than 100 countries. These researchers spend a little time on CERN and the rest of the time they work at their colleges and national research facilities in their home country, so there was a requirement for solid communication so that they can exchange data.\n\n## **System Architecture**\n\nFrom the user\u2019s point of view, the web consists of a vast, worldwide connection of documents or web pages. Each page may contain links to other pages anywhere in the world. The pages can be retrieved and viewed by using browsers of which internet explorer, Netscape Navigator, Google Chrome, etc are the popular ones. The browser fetches the page requested interprets the text and formatting commands on it, and displays the page, properly formatted, on the screen.\n\nThe basic model of how the web works are shown in the figure below. Here the browser is displaying a web page on the client machine. When the user clicks on a line of text that is linked to a page on the abd.com server, the browser follows the hyperlink by sending a message to the abd.com server asking it for the page.\n\n![System Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190717221909/Untitled-Diagram-125.jpg)\n\nHere the browser displays a web page on the client machine when the user clicks on a line of text that is linked to a page on abd.com, the browser follows the hyperlink by sending a message to the abd.com server asking for the page.\n\n## **Working of WWW**\n\nA Web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as programs which display text, data, pictures, animation and video on the Internet. Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers. Initially, Web browsers were used only for surfing the Web but now they have become more universal.\n\nThe below diagram indicates how the Web operates just like [client-server architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/) of the internet. When users request web pages or other information, then the web browser of your system request to the server for the information and then the\u00a0[web server](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-server-and-its-type/)\u00a0 provide requested services to web browser back and finally the requested service is utilized by the user who made the request.\n\n![WWW](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240229113623/WWW.jpg)\n\nWorld Wide Web\n\nWeb browsers can be used for several tasks including conducting searches, mailing, transferring files, and much more. Some of the commonly used browsers are Internet Explorer, Opera Mini, and Google Chrome.\n\n## **Features of WWW**\n\n- WWW is open source.\n- It is a distributed system spread across various websites.\n- It is a Hypertext Information System.\n- It is Cross-Platform.\n- Uses Web Browsers to provide a single interface for many services.\n- Dynamic, Interactive and Evolving.\n\n## **Components of the Web**\n\nThere are 3 components of the web:\n\n- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL):** [**URL**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/components-of-a-url/) serves as a system for resources on the web.\n- **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** [**HTTP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) specifies communication of browser and server.\n- **Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML):** [**HTML**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-introduction/) defines the structure, organisation and content of a web page.\n\n## Difference Between WWW and Internet\n\n| WWW | Internet |\n| --- | --- |\n| It is originated in 1989. | It is originated in 1960. |\n| WWW is an interconnected network of websites and documents that can be accessed via the Internet. | Internet is used to connect a computer with other computer . |\n| WWW used protocols such as HTTP | Internet used protocols such as [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/) |\n| It is based on software. | It is based on hardware. |\n| It is a service contained inside an infrastructure. | There is a entire infrastructure in internet. |\n\n## Web Browser Evolution and the Growth of the World Wide Web\n\nIn the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee and his team created a basic text web browser. It was the release of the more user-friendly Mosaic browser in 1993 that really sparked widespread interest in the World Wide Web (WWW).

Here are the basics of email:\n\n1. An email address: This is a unique identifier for each user, typically in the format of name@domain.com.\n2. An email client: This is a software program used to send, receive and manage emails, such as Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Mail.\n3. An email server: This is a computer system responsible for storing and forwarding emails to their intended recipients.\n\n### To send an email:\n\n1. Compose a new message in your email client.\n2. Enter the recipient\u2019s email address in the \u201cTo\u201d field.\n3. Add a subject line to summarize the content of the message.\n4. Write the body of the message.\n5. Attach any relevant files if needed.\n6. Click \u201cSend\u201d to deliver the message to the recipient\u2019s email server.\n7. Emails can also include features such as cc (carbon copy) and bcc (blind carbon copy) to send copies of the message to multiple recipients, and reply, reply all, and forward options to manage the conversation.\n\n**Electronic Mail** (e-mail) is one of most widely used services of [Internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-internet-and-the-web/). This service allows an Internet user to send a **message in formatted manner (mail)** to the other Internet user in any part of world. Message in mail not only contain text, but it also contains images, audio and videos data. The person who is sending mail is called **sender** and person who receives mail is called **recipient**. It is just like postal mail service. **Components of E-Mail System :** The basic components of an email system are : User Agent (UA), Message Transfer Agent (MTA), Mail Box, and Spool file. These are explained as following below.\n\n1. **User Agent (UA) :** The UA is normally a program which is used to send and receive mail. Sometimes, it is called as mail reader. It accepts variety of commands for composing, receiving and replying to messages as well as for manipulation of the mailboxes.\n2. **Message Transfer Agent (MTA) :** MTA is actually responsible for transfer of mail from one system to another. To send a mail, a system must have client MTA and system MTA. It transfer mail to mailboxes of recipients if they are connected in the same machine. It delivers mail to peer MTA if destination mailbox is in another machine. The delivery from one MTA to another MTA is done by [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/). ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200731122504/Email1.png)\n3. **Mailbox :** It is a file on local hard drive to collect mails. Delivered mails are present in this file. The user can read it delete it according to his/her requirement. To use e-mail system each user must have a mailbox . Access to mailbox is only to owner of mailbox.\n4. **Spool file :** This file contains mails that are to be sent. User agent appends outgoing mails in this file using SMTP. MTA extracts pending mail from spool file for their delivery. E-mail allows one name, an **alias**, to represent several different e-mail addresses. It is known as **mailing list**, Whenever user have to sent a message, system checks recipient\u2019s name against alias database. If mailing list is present for defined alias, separate messages, one for each entry in the list, must be prepared and handed to MTA. If for defined alias, there is no such mailing list is present, name itself becomes naming address and a single message is delivered to mail transfer entity.\n\n**Services provided by E-mail system :**\n\n- **Composition \u2013** The composition refer to process that creates messages and answers. For composition any kind of text editor can be used.\n- **Transfer \u2013** Transfer means sending procedure of mail i.e. from the sender to recipient.\n- **Reporting \u2013** Reporting refers to confirmation for delivery of mail. It help user to check whether their mail is delivered, lost or rejected.\n- **Displaying \u2013** It refers to present mail in form that is understand by the user.\n- **Disposition \u2013** This step concern with recipient that what will recipient do after receiving mail i.e save mail, delete before reading or delete after reading.\n\n### Advantages Or Disadvantages:  Advantages of email:\n\n1. Convenient and fast communication with individuals or groups globally.\n2. Easy to store and search for past messages.\n3. Ability to send and receive attachments such as documents, images, and videos.\n4. Cost-effective compared to traditional mail and fax.\n5. Available 24/7.\n\n### Disadvantages of email:\n\n1. Risk of spam and phishing attacks.\n2. Overwhelming amount of emails can lead to information overload.\n3. Can lead to decreased face-to-face communication and loss of personal touch.\n4. Potential for miscommunication due to lack of tone and body language in written messages.\n5. Technical issues, such as server outages, can disrupt email service.\n6. It is important to use email responsibly and effectively, for example, by keeping the subject line clear and concise, using proper etiquette, and protecting against security threats.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/e-mail-format/?ref=next_article)\n\n[E-Mail Format](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/e-mail-format/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/p1tb8bf3j6eyxoij4gps)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/itskawal2000/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[itskawal2000](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/itskawal2000/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

YouTube alone has 2 Billion users worldwide, while Netflix has over 160 million users. Streaming content to such a wide demographic of users is no easy task. One can think that a straightforward approach to this can be building a large data center, storing all the content in the servers, and providing it to users worldwide. But there are issues that arise when this approach is followed-\n\n1. Firstly if the data center is in the USA and the user is in India there will be slower delivery of content.\n2. Secondly, a single data center represents a single point of failure.\n3. Thirdly, if some content is being accessed frequently from a remote area then it is likely to follow the same links, and this, in turn, results in wastage of bandwidth.\n\n**CDN \u2013 Content Distribution Network or Content Delivery Network** is a solution that provides faster delivery of content to the users distributed worldwide. **What is a CDN?** A CDN is essentially a group of servers that are strategically placed across the globe with the purpose of accelerating the delivery of web content. A CDN-\n\n1. Manages servers that are geographically distributed over different locations.\n2. Stores the web content in its servers.\n3. Attempts to direct each user to a server that is part of the CDN so as to deliver content quickly.\n\n**How does CDN work?** To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website\u2019s server, a CDN stores a cached version of original content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence/ PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers known as edge servers that are responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity. CDN caches content in many places at once, ensuring quick delivery of content. **Let\u2019s consider an example:** Suppose you are hosting a website, wherein your origin server(server containing the primary source of your website\u2019s data, where website files are hosted) is located in Australia and a company XYZ provides you the CDN service. When a user in India clicks on a video on your website, the request goes to the user\u2019s local DNS server( [See DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-server-dns-in-application-layer/)), which relays the request to the authoritative DNS server of your website. The authoritative DNS server then identifies that the user is situated far away and therefore relays the request to its XYZ\u2019s DNS server. Now the DNS query enters XYZ\u2019s network which provides the address of the edge server that is closest to the user to the Local DNS server. The video is delivered by this edge server. From this point onwards the local DNS server knows the address of the edge server. So whenever users within its network send a request for content from your website, the local DNS server shall relay the request to the edge server. CDN thus minimizes the number of hops required to deliver the data to a user\u2019s browser due to the POPs that are located near the user. **Following image depicts the same:**![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200414152147/GfG-CDN-architecture-1024x577.png) Following Image depicts the difference between how a request is handled with and without a CDN respectively: **WITH CDN(2 SECONDS)**![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200414160928/GfG-With-CDN1.jpeg) **WITHOUT CDN(5 SECONDS)**![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200414160914/GfG-Without-CDN1.jpeg)\n\n**Benefits of CDN**\n\n\u25cf Security improvement- The DDOS mitigation improves the security as it contains some security certificates and optimizations.\n\n\u25cf Increase in content availability and redundancy- Hardware failures and more traffic can lead to the website\u2019s dysfunction. CDN can handle traffic and can withstand hardware disfunction better than many servers.\n\n\u25cf Better load times- The visitor has a fast page loading because a nearby CDN server is used whenever a client search for a webpage. CDN also reduces the slow loading times by reducing the bounce rates and increasing the amount of time people spend on site.\n\n\u25cf Low bandwidth cost- The direct cost for hosting a website is bandwidth consumption cost. With the help of caching and other optimizations, it minimizes the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing the hosting costs.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/networking-interview-questions/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Top 50 Plus Networking Interview Questions and Answers for 2024](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/networking-interview-questions/?ref=next_article)\n\n[O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/omkarthorat10/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[omkarthorat10](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/omkarthorat10/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n5\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GBlog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/guestblogs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Write From Home](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/write-from-home/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.
