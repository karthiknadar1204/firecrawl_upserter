It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.\n\nHTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another. Data such as text, images, and other multimedia files are shared on the World Wide Web. Whenever a web user opens their web browser, the user indirectly uses HTTP. It is an application protocol that is used for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.\n\n![HTTP Connection](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230529102853/Screenshot-2023-05-29-102548.webp)\n\n## History of HTTP\n\n- Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are indeed credited with inventing the original HTTP protocol.\n- HTTP version 0.9 was the initial version introduced in 1991.\n- HTTP version 1.0 followed in 1996 with the introduction of RFC 1945.\n- HTTP version 1.1 was introduced in January 1997 with RFC 2068, later refined in RFC 2616 in June 1999.\n- HTTP version 2.0 was specified in RFC 7540 and published on May 14, 2015.\n- HTTP version 3.0, also known as HTTP/3, is based on the QUIC protocol and is designed to improve web performance. It was renamed as Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol QUIC (HTTP/3) and developed by Google.\n\n## Methods of HTTP\n\n- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from a specified resource. It should have no side effects and is commonly used for fetching web pages, images, etc.\n- **POST**: Used to submit data to be processed by a specified resource. It is suitable for form submissions, file uploads, and creating new resources.\n- **PUT**: Used to update or create a resource on the server. It replaces the entire resource with the data provided in the request body.\n- **PATCH**: Similar to PUT but used for partial modifications to a resource. It updates specific fields of a resource rather than replacing the entire resource.\n- **DELETE**: Used to remove a specified resource from the server.\n- **HEAD**: Similar to GET but retrieves only the response headers, useful for checking resource properties without transferring the full content.\n- **OPTIONS**: Used to retrieve the communication options available for a resource, including supported methods and headers.\n- **TRACE**: Used for debugging purposes to echo the received request back to the client, though it's rarely used due to security concerns.\n- **CONNECT**: Used to establish a tunnel to the server through an HTTP proxy, commonly used for SSL/TLS connections.\n\n## HTTP Request/Response:\n\nHTTP is a request-response protocol, which means that for every request sent by a client (typically a web browser), the server responds with a corresponding response. The basic flow of an HTTP request-response cycle is as follows:\n\n- **Client sends an HTTP request**: The client (usually a web browser) initiates the process by sending an HTTP request to the server. This request includes a request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), the target URI (Uniform Resource Identifier, e.g., a URL), headers, and an optional request body.\n- **Server processes the request**: The server receives the request and processes it based on the requested method and resource. This may involve retrieving data from a database, executing server-side scripts, or performing other operations.\n- **Server sends an HTTP response:** After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. The response includes a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), response headers, and an optional response body containing the requested data or content.\n- **Client processes the response**: The client receives the server's response and processes it accordingly. For example, if the response contains an HTML page, the browser will render and display it. If it's an image or other media file, the browser will display or handle it appropriately.\n\n![HTTP Response](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230521175108/ImageOfHTTPRequestResponse-1024x580-660.webp)\n\n## HTTP Request Circle\n\n| Requested Resource | Resource Type | Server Response |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| HTML Page | HTML | Server sends HTML file |\n| Style Sheet (CSS) | CSS | Server sends CSS file |\n| Image (JPG) | Image (JPG) | Server sends JPG image |\n| JavaScript Code | JavaScript (JS) | Server sends JS file |\n| Data (XML or JSON) | Data | Server sends XML/JSON data |\n\n## Overview of HTTP Request and Response Components\n\n| Concept | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| HTTP Request Headers | Text information in key-value pairs sent with every HTTP request, conveying details such as client's browser, requested data, and more. |\n| HTTP Request Body | Contains data being submitted to the web server, such as form inputs, authentication details, or other payload data. |\n| HTTP Response | Sent by the server in answer to an HTTP request, consisting of an HTTP status code, response headers, and optional response body. |\n| HTTP Status Codes | 3-digit codes indicating the outcome of an HTTP request, categorized into 1xx (Informational), 2xx (Success), 3xx (Redirection), 4xx (Client Error), and 5xx (Server Error) blocks. |\n| HTTP Response Headers | Provide important information like data format, language, and content type in the response, helping clients interpret the data correctly. |\n| HTTP Response Body | Contains the requested information sent by the server, such as HTML content for webpages, JSON data, or other data based on the client's request. |\n\n## Features\n\n- **Stateless:** Each request is independent, and the server doesn't retain previous interactions' information.\n- **Text-Based:** Messages are in plain text, making them readable and debuggable.\n- **Client-Server Model:** Follows a client-server architecture for requesting and serving resources.\n- **Request-Response:** Operates on a request-response cycle between clients and servers.\n- **Request Methods:** Supports various methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for different actions on resources.\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Platform independence**: Works on any operating system\n- **Compatibility**: Compatible with various protocols and technologies\n- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance\n- **Security**: Supports encryption for secure data transfer\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- **Lack of security**: Vulnerable to attacks like man in the middle\n- **Performance issues:** Can be slow for large data transfers\n- **Statelessness**: Requires additional mechanisms for maintaining state\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-http-2/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is HTTP/2?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-http-2/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/t0fehsf4ll12jj0y2zau)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/__a_dedicated_sapient__/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[\\_\\_a\\_dedicated\\_sapient\\_\\_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/__a_dedicated_sapient__/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Web Technologies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/?ref=article_category)\n- [HTML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/html/?ref=article_category)\n- [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/http/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is HTTP ?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nHTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a fundamental protocol of the Internet, enabling the transfer of data between a client and a server.

It is the most common protocol for sending data between a web browser and a website. In this article, we will discuss HTTPS, the Working of HTTPS, advantages of HTTPS. We will also discuss SSL ( Secure Socket Layer) in this article.\n\n## What is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure?\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is a protocol that is used to communicate between the user browser and the website. It also helps in the transfer of data. It is the secure variant of HTTP. To make the data transfer more secure, it is encrypted. Encryption is required to ensure security while transmitting sensitive information like passwords, contact information, etc.\n\n![HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240111152750/HTTPS-gif.gif)\n\n## HTTP vs HTTPS\n\nBelow are the basic differences between the HTTP and HTTPS.\n\n| HTTP | HTTPS |\n| --- | --- |\n| HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. | HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. |\n| URL begins with \u201chttp://\u201d. | URL starts with \u201chttps://\u201d. |\n| HTTP Works at the\u00a0[Application Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/). | HTTPS works at\u00a0[Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-responsibilities/). |\n| HTTP speed is faster than HTTPS. | HTTPS speed is slower than HTTP. |\n\nFor more differences between these two, refer to the article [Difference between http:// and https://](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https/).\n\n## How Does HTTPS Work?\n\nHTTPS establishes the communication between the browser and the web server. It uses the **Secure Socket Layer**(SSL) and **Transport Layer Security** (TLS) protocol for establishing communication. The new version of SSL is **TLS(Transport Layer Security)**.\n\nHTTPS uses the conventional HTTP protocol and adds a layer of SSL/TLS over it. The [workflow of HTTP and HTTPS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-http-using-browsers/) remains the same, the browsers and servers still communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol. However, this is done over a secure SSL connection. The SSL connection is responsible for the encryption and decryption of the data that is being exchanged to ensure data safety.\n\n![Working of HTTPS](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211117141004/HTTPSdrawio-660x368.png)\n\n## Secure Socket Layer (SSL)\n\nThe main responsibility of SSL is to ensure that the data transfer between the communicating systems is **secure and reliable**. It is the standard security technology that is used for encryption and decryption of data during the transmission of requests.\n\nAs discussed earlier, HTT PS is basically the same old HTTP but with SSL. For establishing a secure communication link between the communicating devices, SSL uses a digital certificate called **SSL certificate**.\n\nThere are two major roles of the SSL layer\n\n- Ensuring that the browser communicates with the required server directly.\n- Ensuring that only the communicating systems have access to the messages they exchange.\n\n## Encryption in HTTPS\n\nHTTP transfers data in a hypertext format between the browser and the web server, whereas HTTPS transfers data in an encrypted format. As a result, HTTPS protects websites from having their information broadcast in a way that anyone eavesdropping on the network can easily see. During the transit between the browser and the web server, HTTPS protects the data from being accessed and altered by hackers. Even if the transmission is intercepted, hackers will be unable to use it because the me ssage is encrypted.\n\nIt uses an asymmetric public key infrastructure for securing a communication link. There are two different kinds of keys used for encryption \u2013\n\n- **Private Key**: It is used for the decryption of the data that has been encrypted by the public key. It resides on the server-side and is controlled by the owner of the website. It is private in nature.\n- **Public Key**: \u00a0It is public in nature and is accessible to all the users who communicate with the server. The private key is used for the decryption of the data that has been encrypted by the public key.\n\n## Advantage of HTTPS\n\n- **Secure Communication:** HTTPS establishes a secure communication link between the communicating system by providing encryption during transmission.\n- **Data Integrity:** By encrypting the data, HTTPS ensures data integrity. This implies that even if the data is compromised at any point, the hackers won\u2019t be able to read or modify the data being exchanged.\n- **Privacy and Security:** HTTPS prevents attackers from accessing the data being exchanged passively, thereby protecting the privacy and security of the users.\n- **Faster Performance:** TTPS encrypts the data and reduces its size. Smaller size accounts for faster data transmission in the case of HTTPS.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on HTTPS \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Is HTTPS necessary for all websites?\n\n> It is not mandatory for all websites, but it is mostly recommended for all websites that handle important information or content.\n\n### Does HTTPS impact website performance?\n\n> HTPS has a very little impact on performance due to the overhead of encryption and decryption. The overall impact is very minimal.\n\n### Why is HTTPS important?\n\n> As HTTPS provides secure connection between user and website, that why it is important.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-attack-mitigation/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Attack Mitigation?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-attack-mitigation/?ref=next_article)\n\n[N](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/neeraj26pathak/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[neeraj26pathak](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/neeraj26pathak/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n11\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [HTML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/html/?ref=article_category)\n- [Web Technologies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/?ref=article_category)\n- [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/http/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

The [POP protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pop-full-form/) was published in the year 1984. POP has been updated two times namely \u201cPOP2\u201d and \u201cPOP3\u201d. The POP protocol is an Internet Standard Protocol that works on the application layer. It is used to get an access email from the mail server. The need for POP mainly arises when the user or client does not have a continuous internet connection and wants to receive email messages. The Pop client makes use of POP to pull email messages from the POP server. POP3 is the updated version of POP.\n\n## What is POP3?\n\nPOP 3 stands for Post Office Protocol Version 3. POP3 protocol is used to provide access to the mail inbox that is stored in the email server. POP3 protocol can download and delete messages. Once the POP3 client has established a connection with the mail server it can easily retrieve all the messages from the server. The user can access the messages locally even if the user is offline. The protocol does not inherently support real-time synchronization or automatic checking for new messages, users can configure their email clients to check for new messages at intervals or manually. Many email programs, including Apple Mail, Gmail, and Microsoft Outlook, support the POP3 protocol, although IMAP is often preferred for its synchronization features.\n\nWhen a message is sent, SMPT is used to transfer it from the client to the server and ultimately to the server of the recipient. However, the Message Access Agent facilitates the transmission of the message from the receiving server to the host server. POP3 and IMAP are the two types of protocols that are included in the Message Access Agent.\n\n![POP3 Email Protocol ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230817212918/IMG-20230817-WA0019.jpg)\n\nPOP3 Email Protocol\n\n### POP3 Ports\n\nPOP3 makes use of two network ports. They are:\n\n- **Port 110:** Port 110 is a default TCP port used by POP3. But It has a disadvantage that it does not support encrypted communication.\n- **Port 995:** Port 995 is majorly used for more secure applications. Port 995 is a [TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/) or [SSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) port used to provide more security.\n\n## History of POP3\n\nIn 1984, the Internet Engineering Task Force published RFC 918, the initial version of post office protocol. The POP3 protocol was created by the engineers as a straightforward and efficient email protocol that is used to retrieve emails from the server. Instead of accessing the mailbox offline, this offers the option to access the mails offline.\n\nRFC 937 introduced the post office protocol version 2, which was superseded by RFC 1081 in 1988, which introduced the post office protocol version 3. Before POP3 was released, it underwent ten more years of revisions. After it was fully polished, it was released in 1996.\n\nThe POP3 protocol was developed with the fundamental idea that when a client and a server retrieve mail, it goes through three stages. This is true even if the protocol has experienced many improvements. They made an effort to keep this protocol as simple as possible, and because of its simplicity, it is now widely used.\n\n## Working of POP3\n\n- Initially POP3 needs to establish a connection between the POP client and the POP server.\n- Once a secure connection is established several commands are exchanged between them to perform the task.\n- Once a connection is established client requests available email messages.\n- The Server sends the available messages along with their size and unique identifier number.\n- Once the client receives the message, it makes a request to the server for downloading the messages. The user marks such messages and sends them to the server.\n- Upon receiving from the client-server sends the messages selected by the client and accordingly marks them as read or unread.\n- The client if want sends a request for deleting the messages.\n- Once the tasks are completed the client sends a close connection request to the server\n- The server then sends an acknowledgment to the client and closes the connection.\n\n## Advantages of POP3\n\n- The message can be read offline also.\n- POP3 requires less storage space.\n- POP3 is easy to use and configure.\n- POP3 is supported by many email applications.\n- Since our PC already has the emails stored there, accessing them is quick and simple.\n- The size of emails we send and receive is unrestricted.\n- Since all emails are kept locally, less server storage space is needed.\n\n## Disadvantages of POP3\n\n- POP3 does not provide the feature of real-time synchronization.\n- If an email consists of [virus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-computer-virus/) attachments it can affect the system easily.\n- POP3 does not support accessing the same email at the same time on different systems.\n- At a time entire email folder can be discarded.\n- It is also possible for the email folder that is downloaded from the mail server to get corrupted.\n- Since the emails are kept locally, anyone using your computer can access the email folder.\n\n## Difference Between POP3 and IMAP\n\n| POP3 | IMAP |\n| --- | --- |\n| POP\u00a0is a simple protocol that only allows downloading messages from your Inbox to your local computer. | IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)\u00a0is much more advanced and allows the user to see all the folders on the mail server. |\n| The POP server listens on port 110, and the POP with [SSL secure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) (POP3DS) server listens on port 995 | The IMAP server listens on port 143, and the IMAP with SSL secure (IMAPDS) server listens on port 993. |\n| In [POP3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pop3-post-office-protocol-version-3/) the mail can only be accessed from a single device at a time. | Messages can be accessed across multiple devices. |\n| To read the mail it has to be downloaded on the local system. | The mail content can be read partially before downloading |\n| The user can not create, delete or rename email on the mail server. | The user can create, delete or rename an email on the mail server. |\n\nRead more about [Difference between IMAP and POP3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-pop3-and-imap/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on POP3 \u2013 FAQs\n\n### From IMAP and POP3 protocol which provides more security?\n\n> [IMAP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-message-access-protocol-imap/) Provides more security as compared to POP3 as it creates multiple copies of data and stores on ICMP server .Thus if data is lost , a copy of it is resent improving security.\n\n### With POP3 is it possible to access the same email on different systems at the same time?\n\n> No, POP3 does not provide such features. The same email cannot be accessed at the same time on different systems.\n\n### Which ports are used by IMAP?\n\n> [IMAP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-message-access-protocol-imap/) makes use of port 143 and if IMAP is used with SSL secure it makes use of port 993.\n\n### Which email applications make use of POP3?\n\n> POP3 is used by Outlook Express, OSX Mail, Mailbird, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc.\n\n### What is the POP3 maximum size?\n\n> The entire encoded email size is limited by the ServiceNow servers to 75 MB for incoming (POP3) emails and 25 MB for outgoing (SMTP) emails. Emails larger than this are not accepted.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-protocol-version-6-ipv6/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibo6rb0/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[anjalibo6rb0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibo6rb0/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n7\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3)?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nToday email is the most widely used platform for personal and professional business communication.

As a necessary element of the e-mail infrastructure, IMAP revolutionizes the manner customers interact with their digital correspondence. Unlike its predecessor, the Post Office Protocol (POP), IMAP gives a dynamic and synchronized approach to handling emails across multiple gadgets and structures.\n\n## What is IMAP?\n\n**Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)** is an application layer protocol that operates as a contract for receiving emails from the mail server. It was designed by Mark Crispin in 1986 as a remote access mailbox protocol, the current version of [IMAP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-imap-and-smtp/) is IMAP4. It is used as the most commonly used protocol for retrieving emails. This term is also known as Internet mail access protocol, Interactive mail access protocol, and Interim mail access protocol. IMAP retrieves messages from your email provider to your email client (such as on your Mac or PC). Importantly, it does not delete messages from the email service after you download them until the user explicitly deletes them. IMAP allows you to view and manage your emails across multiple devices because it synchronizes the emails between your email client and the server. This synchronization ensures that changes such as read status, deletions, and folder organization are reflected consistently across all devices connected to the same email account.\n\n### **Features of IMAP**\n\n- It is capable of managing multiple mailboxes and organizing them into various categories.\n- Provides adding of message flags to keep track of which messages are being seen.\n- It is capable of deciding whether to retrieve email from a mail server before downloading.\n- It makes it easy to download media when multiple files are attached.\n\n## **Working of IMAP**\n\nIMAP follows Client-server Architecture and is the most commonly used email protocol. It is a combination of client and server process running on other computers that are connected through a network. This protocol resides over the TCP/IP protocol for communication. Once the communication is set up the server listens on port 143 by default which is non-encrypted. For the secure encrypted communication port, 993 is used.\n\n![Internet-Message-Access-Protocol-(IMAP)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240213114027/Internet-Message-Access-Protocol-(IMAP).gif)\n\nIMAP\n\n- Email client Gmail establishes a connection with Gmail\u2019s SMTP server.\n- By approving the sender\u2019s and recipient\u2019s email addresses, the SMTP server verifies (authenticates) that the email can be sent.\n- The email is sent to the Outlook SMTP server by Gmail\u2019s SMTP server.\n- The recipient\u2019s email address is authenticated by the Outlook SMTP server.\n- IMAP or POP3 is used by the Outlook SMTP server to deliver the email to the Outlook email client.\n\n## **Architecture of IMAP**\n\nThe Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) protocol is a client-server model that allows users to access and view email messages stored on remote servers Here is a summary of the events:\n\n![imap-(1)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240213115039/imap-(1).png)\n\nIMAP\n\n- **IMAP clients:** An IMAP client is an email application or software that users use to communicate with their email accounts. Examples include Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and mobile email applications. The client communicates with the IMAP server to receive, manage, and send email messages.\n- **IMAP Server:** The IMAP server manages email messages and manages user mailboxes. It responds to requests from IMAP clients, and provides access to email folders and messages. The server stores emails in a structured format, usually organized in user-defined folders or mailboxes. Common IMAP server software includes Dovecot, Courier IMAP, Cyrus IMAP, and Microsoft Exchange Server.\n- **Network Protocols:** IMAP works over [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/)(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) networks, and allows an IMAP client to connect to an IMAP server over the Internet or local area networks. IMAP typically uses TCP port 143 for unencrypted connections and TCP port 993 for encrypted connections using [SSL/TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/) (IMAPS).\n\n## Steps involve in IMAP Operation\n\n- An email client, like Microsoft Outlook, connects to the server via IMAP when a user registers in.\n- Certain ports are used for connections.\n- The email client shows the headers of every email.\n- IMAP does not automatically download attachments; messages are downloaded to the client only when the user taps on them.\n- Compared to alternative email retrieval protocols like Post Office Protocol 3, users can check their mail more quickly with IMAP ( [POP3)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pop3-post-office-protocol-version-3/).\n- Until they are specifically deleted by the user, emails will stay on the server.\n- While IMAP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security assigns port number 993, the IMAP server listens on port 143.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- It offers synchronization across all the maintained sessions by the user.\n- It provides security over [POP3 protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pop3-post-office-protocol-version-3/) as the email only exists on the IMAP server.\n- Users have remote access to all the contents.\n- It offers easy migration between the devices as it is synchronized by a centralized server.\n- There is no need to physically allocate any storage to save contents.\n\n## **Disadvantages**\n\n- IMAP is complex to maintain.\n- Emails of the user are only available when there is an internet connection.\n- It is slower to load messages.\n- Some emails don\u2019t support IMAP which makes it difficult to manage.\n\n## Difference Between IMAP and POP3\n\n| IMAP | POP3 |\n| --- | --- |\n| IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)\u00a0is much more advanced and allows the user to see all the folders on the mail server. | POP\u00a0is a simple protocol that only allows downloading messages from your Inbox to your local computer. |\n| The IMAP server listens on port 143, and the IMAP with SSL secure(IMAPDS) server listens on port 993. | The POP server listens on port 110, and the POP with SSL secure(POP3DS) server listens on port 995 |\n| Messages can be accessed across multiple devices | In [POP3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pop3-post-office-protocol-version-3/) the mail can only be accessed from a single device at a time. |\n| The mail content can be read partially before downloading. | To read the mail it has to be downloaded on the local system. |\n| The user can create, delete or rename an email on the mail server. | The user can not create, delete or rename email on the mail server. |\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on IMAP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is IMAP?**\n\n> **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)** is an application layer protocol that operates as a contract for receiving emails from the mail server.

It is used as the most commonly used protocol for retrieving emails.\n\n### Advantage of IMAP?\n\n> - It offers synchronization across all the maintained sessions by the user.\n> - It provides security over POP3 protocol as the email only exists on the IMAP server.\n> - Users have remote access to all the contents.\n\n### Does IMAP provide security?\n\n> By default, login information is sent in plain text from the client to the server, therefore passwords and usernames are not encrypted.\n\n### **What is the default port for IMAP?**\n\n> The default port number for IMAP is 143 and for IMAPS it is 993.\n\n### **Does IMAP support folder synchronization?**\n\n> You may access your mail from anywhere via IMAP. Although the majority of email clients will automatically sync your normal folders, such sent, drafts, and trash, to the server, in the event that you need to manually set these or change them for whatever reason, our step-by-step instructions below will direct you in the correct direction.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/manmeetjuneja5/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[manmeetjuneja5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/manmeetjuneja5/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n16\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) serves as a cornerstone of cutting-edge email communication, facilitating seamless get admission to email messages.

LDAP protocol is basically used to access an active directory.\n\n**Features of LDAP:**\n\n1. Functional model of LDAP is simpler due to this it omits duplicate, rarely used and esoteric feature.\n\n2. It is easier to understand and implement.\n\n3. It uses strings to represent data\n\n\n**Directories:**\n\nDirectories are set of object with similar attributes, organised in a logical and hierarchical manner. For example, Telephonic Directories. It is a distributed database application used to manage attributes in a directory.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190616233622/shivani-2.jpg)\n\nLDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries such as:\n\n- Searching for user specified criteria\n\n- Adding an entry\n\n- Deleting an entry\n\n- Modifying an entry\n\n- Modifying the distinguished name or relative distinguished name of an entry\n\n- Comparing an entry\n\n\n**LDAP Models:**\n\nLDAP can be explained by using four models upon which it based:\n\n1. **Information Model:**\n\n\nThis model describes structure of information stored in an LDAP Directory.In this basic information is stored in directory is called an entity. Entries here represents object of interest in real world such as people, server, organization, etc. Entries contain collection of attributes that contain information about object.Every attribute has a type and one or more values. Here types of attribute is associated with syntax and syntax specifies what kind of values can be stored\n\n2. **Naming Model:**\n\n\nThis model describes how information in an LDAP Directory is organized and identified. In this entries are organized in a Tree-Like structure called Directory Information Tree (DIT). Entries are arranged within DIT based on their distinguished name DN. DN is a unique name that unambiguously identifies a single entry.\n\n3. **Functional Model:**\n\n\nLDAP defines operations for accessing and modifying directory entries . In this we discuss about LDAP operations in a programming language independent manner LDAP operations can be divided into following categories:\n\n\n\n```\n\u2022 Query\n\u2022 Update\n\u2022 Authentication\n```\n\n4. **Security Model:**\n\n\nThis model describes how information in LDAP directory can be protected from unauthorized access. It is based on BIND operation. There are several bind operation can be performed.\n\n\n**LDAP Client and Server Interaction:**\n\nIt is quite similar to any other client-server interaction. In this client performs protocol functions against server.The interaction takes place as follows:-\n\n1. A protocol request is send to server by client.\n\n2. Server perform operations on directory such as search, update, delete, etc.\n\n3. The response is sent back to the client.\n\n\nMicrosoft, Open LDAP, Sun, etc can easily be made an LDAP server. if the user don\u2019t want to install directory service but want to use LDAP instruction for available LDAP server then user can use four11, bigfoot etc. Making an LDAP client is quite simple as there are SDK\u2019s in many programming languages such as C, C++, Perl, Java, etc.\n\nUser has to perform certain task to be LDAP client:\n\n```\n(i) Go get SDK for your language\n(ii) Use function of SDK to connect to LDAP\n(iii) Operate on LDAP\n```\n\n**LDAP functions / operations:**\n\n- **(a) For Authentication:**\n\n\nIt includes bind, unbind and abandon operations used to connect and disconnect to and from an LDAP server, establish access rights and protect information. In authentication, client session is established and ended using the functions\n\n\n\n```\n  -> BIND/UNBIND\n  -> Abandon\n```\n\n- **(b) For Query:**\n\n\nIt includes search and compare operations used to retrieve information from a directory. In query, server performs action using function\n\n\n\n```\n  -> Search\n  -> Compare Entry\n```\n\n- **(c) For Update:**\n\n\nIt includes add, delete, modify and modify RDN operations used to update stored information in a directory. In update, we can make changes in directories by using function\n\n\n\n```\n  -> Add an entry\n  -> Delete an entry\n  -> Modify an entry\n```\n\n\n- Client establishes session with server (BIND) using Hostname/IP/and Port Number. For security purposes, user set USER-ID and Password based authentication.\n\n- Server perform operations such as read, update, search, etc.\n\n- Client end session using UNBIND or Abandon function.\n\n\n**Advantages of LDAP:**\n\n- Data present in LDAP is available to many clients and libraries.\n\n- LDAP support many types of application.\n\n- LDAP is very general and has basic security.\n\n\n**Disadvantages in LDAP:**\n\nIt does not handle well relational database.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190616233252/Copy-of-laksh5923.jpg)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-access-protocol-d-channel-lapd/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Link Access Protocol D-channel (LAPD)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-access-protocol-d-channel-lapd/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shivani7081/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[shivani7081](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shivani7081/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n10\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an internet protocol works on TCP/IP, used to access information from directories.

This protocol is an application protocol that is responsible for the synchronization of hosts on a TCP/IP network. NTP was developed by David Mills in 1981 at the University of Delaware. This is required in a communication mechanism so that a seamless connection is present between the computers.\n\n**Features of NTP :**\n\nSome features of NTP are \u2013\n\n- NTP servers have access to highly precise atomic clocks and GPU clocks\n- It uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to synchronize CPU clock time.\n- Avoids even having a fraction of vulnerabilities in information exchange communication.\n- Provides consistent timekeeping for file servers\n\n**Working of NTP :**\n\nNTP is a protocol that works over the application layer, it uses a hierarchical system of time resources and provides synchronization within the stratum servers. First, at the topmost level, there is highly accurate time resources\u2019 ex. atomic or GPS clocks. These clock resources are called stratum 0 servers, and they are linked to the below NTP server called Stratum 1,2 or 3 and so on. These servers then provide the accurate date and time so that communicating hosts are synced to each other.\n\n**Architecture of Network Time Protocol :**\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210111195037/NTP-660x480.png)\n\n**Applications of NTP :**\n\n- Used in a production system where the live sound is recorded.\n- Used in the development of Broadcasting infrastructures.\n- Used where file system updates needed to be carried out across multiple computers depending on synchronized clock times.\n- Used to implement security mechanism which depend on consistent time keeping over the network.\n- Used in network acceleration systems which rely on timestamp accuracy to calculate performance.\n\n**Advantages of NTP :**\n\n- It provides internet synchronization between the devices.\n- It provides enhanced security within the premises.\n- It is used in the authentication systems like Kerberos.\n- It provides network acceleration which helps in troubleshooting problems.\n- Used in file systems that are difficult in network synchronization.\n\n**Disadvantages of NTP :**\n\n- When the servers are down the sync time is affected across a running communication.\n- Servers are prone to error due to various time zones and conflict may occur.\n- Minimal reduction of time accuracy.\n- When NTP packets are increased synchronization is conflicted.\n- Manipulation can be done in synchronization.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configure-and-verify-ntp-operating-in-client-and-server-mode/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Configure and Verify NTP Operating in Client and Server Mode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/configure-and-verify-ntp-operating-in-client-and-server-mode/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/manmeetjuneja5/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[manmeetjuneja5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/manmeetjuneja5/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n18\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Information-Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/information-security/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

These devices are either connected by ethernet or by any wireless means. The communication for transferring files takes place between these connected devices. Therefore network protocols are required. [Network protocols](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-protocols-and-their-uses/) are defined as rules that describe the format of data, sending and receiving of data between the devices connected in a network. The below article covers in detail the Trivial File Transfer Protocol(TFTP).\n\n## TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)\n\nTFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol. TFTP is defined as a protocol that is used to transfer a file from a client to a server and from a server to a client. TFTP is majorly used when no complex interactions are required by the client and server. The service of TFTP is provided by [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) (User Datagram Protocol) and works on port number 69. TFTP does not provide security features therefore it is not used in communications that take place over the Internet. Therefore it is used only for the systems that are set up on the local internet. TFTP requires less amount of memory.\n\n![IMG-20230812-WA0005](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230812112428/IMG-20230812-WA0005.jpg)\n\nTFTP Protocol\n\n## TFTP Message Formats\n\nThere are four types of TFTP Message formats. They are as follows\n\n### 1\\. Read Request:\n\nRead Request is also known as Type 1. A read request is used by the client to get a copy of a file from the server. Below is the format of the Read Request\n\n| ### Read Request (1)<br>### (2 Octets) | ### File Name<br>### (variable) | ### 0<br>### (1 Octet) | ### Mode<br>### (Variable) | ### 0<br>### (1 Octet) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n### 2\\. Write Request:\n\nWrite Request is also known as Type 2. Write Request is being used by the client for writing a file into the server. Below is the format of the Write Request.\n\n| ### Write Request(2)<br>### (2 Octets) | ### File Name<br>### (variable) | ### 0<br>### (1 Octet) | ### Mode<br>### (Variable) | ### 0<br>### (1 Octet) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n### 3\\. Data\n\nData is also known as Type 3. Data consists of a portion of a file that is being copied. The data block is of fixed size that is 512 octets. Below is the format of the Data.\n\n| ### Data (3)<br>### (2 Octets) | ### Sequence Number<br>### (2 Octets) | ### Data<br>### (Upto 512 octets) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n### 4\\. Acknowledgement\n\nAcknowledgment is also known as Type 4. The data present at the last in the message consists of the End of File(EOF) where the size is less than 512 octets. This acknowledgment is used by both client and server for acknowledging the received data.\n\n| ### Ack(4)<br>### (2 Octets) | ### Sequence Number<br>### (2 Octets) |\n| --- | --- |\n\n## Working of TFTP\n\n- TFTP makes use of port number 69 as it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n- When the connection is established successfully between client and server, the client makes a Read Request (RRQ) or\n- Write Request( WRQ). If a client wants to only read the file it requests RRQ and if the client wants to write some data into a server then it requests for WRQ.\n- Once the connection is established and a request is made communication of files takes place in the form of small packets. These packets are 512 bytes each.\n- The server then communicates the packet back to the client and waits until it receives an acknowledgment from the client that the packet has been received.\n- When the acknowledgment is received from the client side, the server again sends the next packet which is 512 bytes each.\n- The same steps as mentioned above continue until the last packet is sent by the server to the client.\n\n### Advantages of TFTP\n\n- TFTP Protocol makes use of User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\n- TFTP requires less amount of memory.\n- TFTP is simple to implement.\n- TFTP is supported by many network devices such as routers, firewalls, and switches.\n- TFTP has low overhead as compared to other protocols and therefore can be used for low-bandwidth networks.\n- TFTP can transfer small files such as boot files, and firmware images more fastly.\n\n### Disadvantages of TFTP\n\n- TFTP does not provide any security features\n- TFTP does not provide any approach for error checking.\n- TFTP can be used for limited functionalities only.\n- TFTP servers do not allow the renaming and deletion of files.\n\n### Applications of TFTP\n\n- TFTP is used to transfer files within clients and sever connected in a network.\n- TFTP is used to transfer the configuration files within the network.\n- TFTP is used to update the firmware on the devices connected to the network\n- TFTP is used in applications where no authentication is required.\n\n> Difference between TFTP and SFTP: [TFTP vs SFTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-sftp-and-tftp/)\n>\n> Difference between FTP and TFTP: [FTP vs TFTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ftp-and-tftp/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on TFTP\n\n#### Q1. In the working of TFTP what if the file is not received by the client during communication?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> When the server sends the packet to the client it puts on the timer. If any acknowledgement is not received from the client side the server again sends this packet. Upon receiving the acknowledgment from the client, served and then sends the next packet.\n\n#### Q2. Why TFTP is considered an unsecured protocol?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> TFTP does not provide any security features such as authentication, it does not have any error recovery methods and the data that is transferred is not encrypted. Therefore TFTP is considered an unsecured protocol.\n\n#### Q3. What is the difference between [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp/) and TFTP?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Both FTP and TFTP are used for transferring files from one system to another but the difference between both is that FTP provides more security and allows complex functions, commands, and operations on data whereas TFTP does not provides security features and complex commands.\n\n#### Q4. What is meant by a TFTP server?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> TFTP server provides communication with the TFTP client for sending and receiving the files in the form of packets.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sftp-file-transfer-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[SFTP File Transfer Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sftp-file-transfer-protocol/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibo6rb0/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[anjalibo6rb0](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibo6rb0/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n7\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe network is made up of various devices.

Network News Transfer Protocol is used to transfer news from one network to another. It is designed specifically to transfer news/articles. A NNTP client is included in browsers like Netscape, Opera and Internet Explorer or a special application named newsreader can be used as a NNTP client. NNTP servers manages the global network of news groups.\n\n**History:**\n\nUsenet originally used the Unix to Unix Copy Protocol (UUCP). In this protocol, servers copied all news on their local disks, posters and readers logged in to these servers to access articles directly from the local disk. It was necessary to make UseNet accessible for personal computers with increase in use of the Internet. Hence NNTP was designed on similar lines to that of [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/). It was made by multiple contributors which included Brain Kantor, Phil Lapsley, Sant.O.Barber, Erik Fair. Brain Kantor and Phil Lapsley wrote the RFC 977, \u201cNetwork News Transfer Protocol\u201d in March 1986.\n\n**Working:**\n\nNNTP is a set of rules for clients/newsreaders to interact with servers to retrieve newsgroups. NNTP client communicates with a server using commands like \u201cARTICLE\u201d to retrieve an article or \u201cNEWS\u201d to retrieve a whole newsgroup etc. Mostly these commands are interpreted directly by newsreader software which sends and receives signals from the servers.\n\nPort 563 or 119 is used by NNTP clients/newsreaders. Post 433 is used by Servers hence it is also called NNSP.\n\nThe newsgroups are hosted by multiple servers. The servers in this distributed network are simple peers which have information about other peers with whom they share articles. A new article is added to a server, the server periodically sends added articles to it\u2019s peer servers. A server need not store all the newsgroups on the network, it can choose which newsgroups it will store, provided it\u2019s peer has those newsgroups.And if the peer doesn\u2019t, then it can find new peers which have those newsgroups.Anyone can setup personal newsgroups using software like Apache James and Leaf node.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-time-protocol-ntp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-time-protocol-ntp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/omkarchalke/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[omkarchalke](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/omkarchalke/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n3\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Web Technologies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/web-technologies/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetwork News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is the underlying protocol of UseNet, which is a worldwide discussion system which contains posts or articles which are known as news.

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport is a perfect protocol for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication since it is designed specifically for low-bandwidth, high-latency settings.\n\n## What is Message Queue Telemetry Transport Protocol(MQTT)?\n\n**MQTT** is a simple, lightweight messaging protocol used to establish communication between multiple devices. It is a TCP-based protocol relying on the publish-subscribe model. This communication protocol is suitable for transmitting data between resource-constrained devices having low bandwidth and low power requirements. Hence this messaging protocol is widely used for communication in the [IoT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-things-iot-2/) Framework.\n\n### **Publish-Subscribe Model**\n\nThis model involves multiple clients interacting with each other, without having any direct connection established between them. All clients communicate with other clients only via a third party known as a Broker.\n\n### **MQTT Client and Broker**\n\nClients publish messages on different topics to brokers. The broker is the central server that receives these messages and filters them based on their topics. It then sends these messages to respective clients that have subscribed to those different topics.\u00a0The heart of any publish/subscribe protocol is the MQTT broker. A broker can handle up to thousands of concurrently connected MQTT customers, depending on how it is implemented. All communications must be received by the broker, who will then sort them, ascertain who subscribed to each one, and deliver the messages to the clients who have subscribed. All persistent customers\u2019 sessions, including missed messages and subscriptions, are likewise kept by the Broker.\n\n![Message Queue Telemetry Transport Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240213115836/GeeksForGeeksPublishSubscribeModel-768.png)\n\nPublish-Subscribe Model\n\nHence client that has subscribed to a specific topic receives all messages published on that topic.\n\nHere the broker is central hub that receives messages, filters them, and distributes them to appropriate clients, such that both message publishers, as well as subscribers, are clients.\n\n## Working of MQTT\n\nMQTT\u2019s publish/subscribe (pub/sub) communication style, which aims to maximise available bandwidth, is an alternative to conventional client-server architecture that communicates directly with an endpoint. In contrast, the client who transmits the message (the publisher) and the client or clients who receive it (the subscribers) are not connected in the pub/sub paradigm. Third parties\u2014the brokers\u2014manage the relationships between the publishers and subscribers because they don\u2019t communicate with one another directly.\n\nPublishers and subscribers, which denote whether a client is publishing messages or has subscribed to receive messages, are examples of MQTT clients. The same MQTT client can be used to accomplish these two features. A publish occurs when a client or device want to submit data to a server or broker.\n\nThe term \u201csubscribe\u201d refers to the reversal of the procedure. Several clients can connect to a broker under the pub/sub paradigm and subscribe to subjects that interest them.\n\n![Introduction-of-Message-Queue-Telemetry-Transport-Protocol-(MQTT)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240213115540/Introduction-of-Message-Queue-Telemetry-Transport-Protocol-(MQTT).gif)\n\nMQTT\n\nWhen a broker and a subscribing client lose contact, the broker will store messages in a buffer and send them to the subscriber whenever the broker is back up and running. The broker has the right to cut off communication with subscribers and send them a cached message containing publisher instructions if the publishing client abruptly disconnects from the broker.\n\n\u201cPublishers send the messages, subscribers receive the messages they are interested in, and brokers pass the messages from the publishers to the subscribers,\u201d reads an IBM write-up describing the pub/sub paradigm. MQTT clients, such as publishers and subscribers, can only speak with MQTT brokers. Any device or programme that runs a MQTT library can be a MQTT client, ranging from microcontrollers like the Arduino to entire application servers housed in the cloud.\n\n## Characterstics of MQTT\n\n- **Lightweight:** MQTT is designed to be lightweight, making it suitable for use in aid-restrained environments inclusive of embedded systems and low-strength devices. The protocol minimizes bandwidth and processing overhead, enabling green communication even on restricted networks.\n- **Publish-Subscribe Model:** In the publish-subscribe version, clients (publishers) send messages to subjects, and different clients (subscribers) acquire messages from subjects of interest. This decoupling of producers and purchasers permits for flexible and dynamic conversation styles.\n- **Quality of Service (QoS) Levels:** MQTT supports exclusive stages of message delivery warranty, referred to as [Quality of Service (QoS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-quality-of-service-and-multimedia/). QoS levels range from 0 to 2, providing various stages of reliability and message transport guarantees, relying at the utility necessities.\n- **Retained Messages:** MQTT lets in agents to store retained messages on topics, making sure that new subscribers acquire the maximum latest message posted on a subject right now after subscribing. This characteristic is beneficial for fame updates and configuration settings.\n- **Last Will and Testament (LWT):** MQTT clients can specify a Last Will and Testament message to be posted by way of the broker in the occasion of an sudden consumer disconnect. This function affords a mechanism for detecting patron failures and dealing with them gracefully.\n- **Security:** MQTT helps various protection mechanisms, consisting of [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/) encryption and authentication mechanisms which include username/password and consumer certificates. These capabilities make certain the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged over MQTT connections.\n\n## **Advantages of MQTT**\n\nThis model is not restricted to one-to-one communication between clients. Although the publisher client sends a single message on specific topic, broker sends multiple messages to all different clients subscribed to that topic. Similarly, messages sent by multiple such publisher clients on multiple different topics will be sent to all multiple clients subscribed to those topics.\u00a0Hence one-to-many, many-to-one, as well as many-to-many communication is possible using this model. Also, clients can publish data and at the same time receive data due to this two-way communication protocol. Hence MQTT is considered to be bi-directional protocol. The default unencrypted MQTT port used for data transmission is 1883. The encrypted port for secure transmission is 8883.\n\n- Lightweight protocol that is quick to create and allows for efficient data transport\n- Minimal data packet usage, resulting in low network usage\n- Effective data dispersion\n- The effective use of remote sensing and control\n- Prompt and effective message delivery\n- Minimises power consumption, which is beneficial for the linked devices, and maximises network capacity.\n- Data transmission is quick, efficient, and lightweight because MQTT messages have small code footprint. These control messages have a fixed header of size 2 bytes and payload message up to size 256 megabytes.\n\n## Disadvantages of MQTT\n\n- When compared to Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), MQTT has slower send cycles.\n- Resource discovery in MQTT is based on flexible topic subscription, while resource discovery in CoAP is based on a reliable system.\n- MQTT lacks encryption. Rather, security encryption is accomplished by TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer).\n- Building an internationally scalable MQTT network is challenging.\n\n### What is Topic?\n\nIn MQTT, topic is UTF-8 string that the broker uses to filter messages for each individual connected client. Each topic consists of one or more different topic levels. Each topic level is separated by forward slash also called topic level separator. Both topics and levels are case-sensitive.\n\n**Example of topic \u2013**\n\n```\nhome/kitchen/table\n```\n\nHere, \u201chome\u201d, \u201ckitchen\u201d and \u201ctable\u201d are different levels of topic.\n\nWildcard is an additional feature used in MQTT to make topics and their levels more flexible and user-friendly.\n\nMQTT Topics include two types of wildcards:\n\n**1\\. Single Level: \u201c+\u201d**\n\nSingle-level wildcard represented by \u201c+\u201d symbol can replace single level in topic.\n\n**Example \u2013**\n\nIf the client wants information about all tables present inside the house, it will subscribe to the topic :\n\n```\nhome/+/table\n```\n\nHence any information published related to tables, inside the kitchen, living room, bedroom, etc, can be obtained on this topic.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717154441/SingleLevelTopics.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** Single-Level Topics in MQTT\n\n**2\\. Multi-Level: \u201c#\u201d**\n\nMulti-level wildcard represented by \u201c#\u201d symbol can replace multiple levels in topic.\n\n**Example \u2013**\n\nIf a client wants information about all objects present inside the kitchen, living room, bedroom, or any other room on ground floor, it will subscribe to topic:\n\n```\nhome/groundfloor/#\n```\n\nHence any information published on topics related to kitchen items, bedroom items, living room items can be obtained on this topic. Information up to multiple levels can be obtained in this case.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717154424/MultiLevelTopics.png)\n\nThe following program illustrates how MQTT can be implemented in javascript.\n\n- Javascript\n\n## Javascript\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `//JavaScript Program for publish-subscribe model`<br>`/* jshint esversion : 6 */`<br>`\"use strict\"` `;`<br>`//Importing MQTT`<br>`var` `mqtt = require(` `'mqtt'` `);`<br>`//Creating an instance of the client`<br>`var` `client = mqtt.connect({clientId: ` `\"001\"` `});`<br>`//Definiting constants`<br>`var` `topic = ` `\"home/kitchen/table\"` `;`<br>`var` `message = ` `\"Table inside the kitchen\"` `;`<br>`var` `options = {retain: ` `false` `, qos: 1};`<br>`//On successful connection`<br>`client.on(` `'connect'` `, ` `function` `() {`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``console.log(` `\" After successful connection: \"` `, client.connected);`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``//If client is connected, then publish on the topic`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``if` `(client.connected) {`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``console.log(` `\" Publishing on topic: \"` `, topic);`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``client.publish(topic, message, options);`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``}`<br>`});`<br>`//On connectivity error`<br>`client.on(` `'error'` `, ` `function` `(error) {`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``console.log(` `\" Connection error: \"` `, error);`<br>`});`<br>`//On receiving message`<br>`client.on(` `'message'` `, ` `function` `(topic, message) {`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``console.log(` `\" Received message: \"` `, message.toString(), ` `\"on topic: \"` `, topic);`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``client.end();`<br>`});`<br>`function` `init() {`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``//Subscribing to the topic`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``console.log(` `\"\n Subscribing to topic\"` `);`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0``client.subscribe(topic, {qos: 1});`<br>`}`<br>`//Start of the program`<br>`init();` |\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on MQTT \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is MQTT?\n\n> **MQTT** is a simple, lightweight messaging protocol used to establish communication between multiple devices.

It\u2019s one module. it\u2019s ready to establish two way party session, multiparty session and multicast session. It\u2019s design independent of underlying transport layer. It\u2019s ready to run on [UDP or TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/).\n\n**SIP address :**\n\nIn a regular telephone communication, a phone number identifies the sender and another phone number identifies the receiver. In SIP, the sender and receiver are often identified by any of these.\n\n1. An Email address.\n\n2. An IP address.\n\n3. A Phone number\n\nThe representation is represented as URLs using sip scheme :\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200919105002/SIPaddress.png)\n\nSIP address schemes\n\n**SIP messages :**\n\nSIP may be a text based protocol modeled on HTTP. It uses messages in ASCII text. Each message features a header and a body. the varied SIP messages are as follows.\n\n| Sr. No. | Message | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | INVITE | It requests for initiation of a session. |\n| 2. | ACK | It confirms that session has initiated. |\n| 3. | BYE | It request for the termination of the session. |\n| 4. | OPTIONS | It query a host about its capabilities. |\n| 5. | CANCEL | It will cancel the pending request. |\n| 6. | REGISTER | It informs a redirection server about the user\u2019s current location. |\n\n**SIP Session :**\n\nA simple session using SIP consists of the following.\n\n1. Establishing a session.\n\n2. Communication.\n\n3. Terminating the session\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200919105830/SIPsession.png)\n\nSIP Session\n\n**Establishing a session :**\n\nIt requires a three-way handshake. The caller will send INVITE message. If the caller is willing to start out, he/she sends a reply message. to verify that a reply code is received, the caller send an ACK message.\n\n**Communication :**\n\nAfter establishment of session, the caller and callee communicate using two temporary ports.\n\n**Terminating the session :**\n\nThe session can often terminated by using BYE message send by either caller or callee.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-messaging-protocols-in-iot/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Session Layer Messaging Protocols in IoT](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-messaging-protocols-in-iot/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/p1tb8bf3j6eyxoij4gps)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/itskawal2000/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[itskawal2000](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/itskawal2000/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Application Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-application-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Session Initiation Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nSession Initiation Protocol was designed by IETF and is described in RFC 3261.

[SMB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-microsoft-smb-a-network-file-sharing-protocol/) enumeration is a multipart process in which we enumerate the host or target system for different information like Hostnames, List shares, [null sessions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-null-session/), checking for [vulnerabilities,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vulnerabilities-in-information-security/) etc.\n\n### **SMB Enumeration Stages:**\n\n- Hostname enumeration\n- List Share\n- Checking Null session\n- List users\n- [Vulnerability Scanning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vulnerability-scanning-in-kali-linux/)\n- Overall Scanning\n\n### **SMB Enumeration for Hostname**\n\nThere are plenty of tools that can enumerate Hostname, here to demonstrate we are using nmblookup and nbtscan. Nmblookup tool makes use of queries of the NetBIOS names and maps them to their related [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) in a network.\n\n**1\\. Nmblookup:**\n\n```\n$ nmblookup -A <Target IP>\n```\n\n![nmblookup](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220917131836/smbenum.png)\n\nHere, you can see that we have enumerated the hostname to CAJA.\n\n**2\\. Nbtscan:**\n\n```\n$ nbtscan <target IP>\n```\n\n![nbtscan](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220917132407/smbenum2.png)\n\nHere, you can see that we have enumerated the hostname to CAJA as the same as the above scan through nmblookup.\n\n### **SMB Enumeration for Share and Null Session:**\n\nIn this part, we are going to enumerate shares of the host or target system. We can perform this enumeration with many tools, for this article we are going to use smbmap, smbclient, Nmap, and Metasploit for different ways of performing this share enumeration.\n\n**1\\. Smbmap:** Smbmap allows the attacker to enumerate samba share drives on the IP address. It also lists drive permissions and upload/download functionality.\n\n```\n$ smbmap -H <target IP>\n```\n\n![smbmap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220917184841/smbshare.png)\n\nAlso, you can scan for specific user shares using the credentials by using the below command\n\n```\n$ smbmap -H <target IP> -u username -p password\n\n```\n\n**2\\. smbclient:** It is a samba-client, and it is useful to test connectivity to windows shares.\n\n```\n$ smbclient -L <target IP>\n```\n\n![smbclient](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220917190103/smbclient.png)\n\n**3\\. Nmap:** [Nmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nmap-command-in-linux-with-examples/) provides smb-enum-shares NSE script which can be used to enumerate the shares.\n\n```\n$ nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 139,445 <Target IP>\n```\n\n![nmap](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220917190937/smbnmap.png)\n\nHere is the result as you can see that we didn\u2019t find any SMB share detail.\n\n**4\\. Metasploit:** In [Metasploit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-metasploit/), we are going to the smb\\_enumshares module that will enumerate any SMB share if present on the server.\n\n```\nmsf6> use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares\nmsf6> auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_enumshares) > set rhosts <target IP>\nmsf6> auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_enumshares) > set smbuser <username>\nmsf6> auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_enumshares) > set smbpass <password>\nmsf6> auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_enumshares) > exploit\n```\n\n### **SMB Enumeration for Vulnerability Scanning:**\n\nIn this stage, we use Nmap\u2019s script for scanning for vulnerabilities that could possibly be found on the server. We can use various tools for this stage but here we are going to look at Nmap\u2019s NSE script.\n\n**Nmap\u2019s smb-vuln NSE Script:**\n\nNmap has a wide range of scripts for different purposes, here as an example we are going to look at smb-check-vulns. This script can scan targets for a wide range of vulnerabilities, for example:\n\n- a -3103\n- regsv-dos\n- ms06 -025\n\n```\n$ sudo nmap --script smb-vuln* -p 139,445 <Target IP>\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n![nmap scan for SMB Vulnerability scanning](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220920102943/smbvuln.png)\n\nResult here we scanned the target for the specific script, and we didn\u2019t find any vulnerability as we can see in the scan.\n\n### **SMB Enumeration by Enum4Linux:**\n\nEnum4linux is a powerful tool that can detect and fetch data from both [windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interesting-facts-about-windows/) and [Linux OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/), also SMB hosts on the network.\n\n```\n$ enum4linux -U <target IP>\n```\n\n**Example:**\n\n![Enum4Linux](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220920110216/Screenshotfrom20220920110134.png)\n\n**Result:**\n\nAs we can see that it has enumerated all the user information that is present on the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-two-factor-authentication-2fa-work/?ref=next_article)\n\n[How Does Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Work?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-does-two-factor-authentication-2fa-work/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/t4euxql9qkb02zri1ypd)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/0xshivam/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[0xshivam](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/0xshivam/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Ethical Hacking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/ethical-hacking/?ref=article_category)\n- [Ethical Hacking - Enumeration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/ethical-hacking-enumeration/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Combinations\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCombination is a way of choosing items from a set, (unlike permutations) when the order of selection doesn't matter.
