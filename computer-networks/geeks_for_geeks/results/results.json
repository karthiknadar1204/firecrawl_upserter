Below are the main components of a computer network.\n\n- **Node** : Any device which can share or receive data. Examples of devices are laptop, mobile, printer, earbuds and server.\n- **Transmission Media :** The medium through which devices communicate It can be a wired media like Optical Fiber and Ethernet Cables. It can also be a wireless media like WiFi, Bluetooth and Infrared.\n- **Protocol** : The set of rules that devices use to communicate. There are many different protocols for different types of communications. Examples are HTTP (For web browsing) and SMTP (For emails).\n- **Networking Devices** : The devices with main purpose of providing network facilities. Examples are Router, Switch, Access Point and Hub.\n- **Networking Applications**: Software that provide an interface to communicate and share. Examples are browser, email clients, and file sharing applications\n\nComputer networks are an important part of our daily lives. They allow devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets to connect and communicate with each other. Whether you\u2019re browsing the internet, sending an email, or streaming a video, it all happens because of computer networks.\n\n## Fundamentals of Computer Network\n\n- [Basics of Computer

Key characteristics include the network\u2019s size (like local or wide area), the way data is transferred (wired or wireless), and the network\u2019s layout (such as star or mesh). These features help determine how well the network performs and meets the needs of its users.\n\nComputer networks are a system of interconnected computers and other devices that allow for the sharing of information and resources. They can range in size from a few connected devices in a small office to millions of devices spread out across the globe. In this article, we are going to discuss some basic characteristics of Computer Networks.\n\n## Basic Characteristics of Computer Network\n\n![ characteristics of Computer Networks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240604163259/Characteristic-of-CN.png)\n\ncharacteristics of Computer Networks\n\n## 1\\. **Security**\n\n**Security**\u00a0is one of the most important characteristics of a computer network. Most businesses nowadays depend on computers, which are accessed by using network. If computer network technology is not secure, then any one can able to access companies data and this in not good for any company, because those who unautharize data can missuse of the data . However, nowadays, computer networking tools primarily provide the highest level of security and prevent any unauthorized access.\n\nComputer networks are vulnerable to [security threats](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-security-threats/) such as hacking, viruses, and data breaches. Security measures such as firewalls, encryption, and user authentication are essential to protect network resources and data.\n\n## 2. **Reliability**\n\nComputer networks must be reliable to ensure that data and resources are always available when needed. Redundancy and [backup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-backup-and-recovery/) systems can help to ensure that the network remains operational in the event of a failure.\n\n## 3. **Scalability**\n\nScalability means a network can grow and handle more users or devices without losing performance. The internet is a great example of this: even as millions of new users connect and communicate with other devices, the network continues to work well.\n\nComputer networks must be scalable to accommodate growth and changing needs. As the number of devices and users on the network increases, the network must be able to handle the additional traffic and data.\n\n## 4\\. Flow of Data\n\nComputer networks let users access and share data like files and documents between devices. This feature is essential because it enables data to move smoothly from one device to another.\n\n## **5\\. High Performance**\n\nPerformance is measured by how quickly a command is executed. If data transfers fast and responses are quick, it benefits users by making data sharing and resource usage more efficient. Using multiple processors can further enhance performance.\n\nThe performance of a computer network is determined by factors such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. These factors affect the speed and responsiveness of the network and can impact the user experience.\n\n## 6\\. Fault Tolerance\n\n[Fault tolerance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fault-tolerance-techniques-in-computer-system/) is a valuable feature of computer networks. For example, if two devices are connected by both wired and wireless means, and the wireless connection fails, the data can still be sent through the wired connection. This ensures that communication continues smoothly even if part of the network is down or damaged.\n\n## 7\\. Quality of Service (QoS)\n\nIt means people can choose what data gets sent first and how it\u2019s sent, making sure it goes fast. If some data doesn\u2019t make it through, the system can handle that too. This makes sure users get a good experience when using the network.\n\n## 8\\. Compatible With Hardware and Software Components\n\nAnother important characteristics of computer network is that it lets lots of devices use the same software. This means you can use the same program on different [hardware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-vs-hardware-load-balancers/). This makes things work better together and makes software easier to use. Plus, it helps make the most out of the stuff you have.\n\n## Other Characteristics of Computer Network\n\n### **Connectivity**\n\nThe primary purpose of a computer network is to enable devices to communicate with each other. Connectivity is established through a variety of wired and wireless technologies, such as Ethernet cables, [Wi-Fi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-wi-fiwireless-fidelity/), and [Bluetooth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bluetooth/).\n\n### **Standards and Protocols**\n\nComputer networks rely on standards and protocols to ensure that devices can communicate with each other. Standards such as TCP/IP and Ethernet, and protocols such as [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/) and [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/), are used to ensure interoperability between devices and networks.\n\n### **Management and Administration**\n\nComputer networks require ongoing management and [administration](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-management-and-administration/) to ensure that they continue to function properly. This includes tasks such as monitoring network performance, configuring devices, and troubleshooting issues.\n\nComputer networks are essential for enabling communication and resource sharing between devices and users. They must be scalable, secure, reliable, and performant, and rely on standards and protocols to ensure interoperability. Effective management and administration are also critical to ensuring the ongoing operation and maintenance of the network.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article we discussed about characteristics of computer network so there are eight important characteristics of computer network these are reliability, Security, Scalability, Fault tolerance, High performance, [Quality Of Services,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-quality-of-service-and-multimedia/) Flow of data, and compatile with hardware and software.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Characteristics of Computer Networks \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What are the four important network characteristics?\n\n> Four important network characteristics are:\n>\n> - \u00a0Fault Tolerance\n> - Scalability\n> - Quality of Service (QoS)\n> - Security\n\n### What are the basic types of computer network?\n\n> There are five main type of computer network:\n>\n> - LAN (Local Area Network)\n> - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)\n> - WAN (Wide Area Network)\n> - PAN (Personal Area Network)\n> - VPN (Virtual Private Network)\n\n### What are the main characteristics of a network operating system?\n\n> Characteristics of network operating systems are\n>\n> - Processor support\n> - Hardware detection and\u00a0multiprocessing\n> - Printer and Devices sharing\n> - File sharing and database sharing\n> - Network security capabilities\n> - Directory services\n> - Backup and web services\n> - Internetworking.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/challenges-of-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Challenges of Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/challenges-of-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/mayank_bohra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[mayank\\_bohra](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/mayank_bohra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n17\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

In this article, we will discuss computer networks and their types.\n\n## What is a Computer Network?\n\nA [computer network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-computer-networking/) is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either\u00a0[cable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-coaxial-cable/)\u00a0or\u00a0[wireless media.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wired-and-wireless-networking/)\u00a0Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.\n\n## Uses of Computer Networks\n\n- Communicating using email, video, instant messaging, etc.\n- Sharing devices such as printers, scanners, etc.\n- Sharing files.\n- Sharing software and operating programs on remote systems.\n- Allowing network users to easily access and maintain information.\n\n## Types of Computer Networks\n\nThere are mainly five types of Computer Networks\n\n1. [Personal Area Network (PAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-personal-area-network-pan/)\n2. [Local Area Network (LAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/)\n3. [Campus Area Network (CAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-campus-area-network-can/)\n4. [Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-full-form-in-computer-networking/)\n5. [Wide Area Network (WAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wan-full-form/)\n\n![Types of Computer Network](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230321163323/Network.png)\n\nTypes of Computer Networks\n\n## **1\\. Personal Area Network (PAN)**\n\n[PAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-personal-area-network-pan/) is the most basic type of computer network. It is a type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person. It allows your personal devices, like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and wearables, to communicate and share data with each other. PAN offers a network range of 1 to 100 meters from person to device providing communication. Its transmission speed is very high with very easy maintenance and very low cost. This uses [Bluetooth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bluetooth/) **,** [IrDA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/irda-infrared-data-association/) **,** and [Zigbee](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-zigbee/) as technology. Examples of PAN are USB, computer, phone, tablet, printer, PDA, etc.\n\n![Personal Area Network (PAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501203401/Screenshot207.png)\n\nPersonal Area Network (PAN)\n\n### Types of PAN\n\n- **Wireless Personal Area Networks:** Wireless Personal Area Networks are created by simply utilising wireless technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth. It is a low-range network.\n- **Wired Personal Area Network:** A wired personal area network is constructed using a USB.\n\n### **Advantages of PAN**\n\n- PAN is relatively flexible and provides high efficiency for short network ranges.\n- It needs easy setup and relatively low cost.\n- It does not require frequent installations and maintenance\n- It is easy and portable.\n- Needs fewer technical skills to use.\n\n### Disadvantages of PAN\n\n- Low network coverage area/range.\n- Limited to relatively low data rates.\n- Devices are not compatible with each other.\n- Inbuilt WPAN devices are a little bit costly.\n\n### **Applications of PAN**\n\n- Home and Offices\n- Organizations and the Business sector\n- Medical and Hospital\n- School and College Education\n- Military and Defense\n\n## **2\\. Local Area Network (LAN)**\n\nLAN is the most frequently used network. A [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) is a computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, that is, locally. A LAN encompasses two or more computers connected over a server. The two important technologies involved in this network are [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/local-area-network-lan-technologies/) and [Wi-fi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-wi-fiwireless-fidelity/). \u00a0It ranges up to 2km & transmission speed is very high with easy maintenance and low cost. Examples of LAN are networking in a home, school, library, laboratory, college, office, etc.\n\n![Local Area Network (LAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210502003635/Screenshot228.png)\n\nLocal Area Network (LAN)\n\n### Advantages of a LAN\n\n- **Privacy:**\u00a0LAN is a private network, thus no outside regulatory body controls it, giving it a privacy.\n- **High Speed:**\u00a0LAN offers a much higher speed(around 100 mbps) and data transfer rate comparatively to\u00a0WAN.\n- **Supports different transmission mediums:**\u00a0LAN support a variety of communications transmission medium such as an Ethernet cable (thin cable, thick cable, and twisted pair), fiber and wireless transmission.\n- **Inexpensive and Simple:**\u00a0A LAN usually has low cost, installation, expansion and maintenance and LAN installation is relatively easy to use, good scalability.\n\n### Disadvantages of LAN\n\n- The initial setup costs of installing Local Area Networks is high because there is special software required to make a server.\n- Communication devices like an ethernet cable, switches,\u00a0[hubs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-hub), routers, cables are costly.\n- LAN administrator can see and check personal data files as well as [Internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-and-its-services)\u00a0history of each and every LAN user. Hence, the privacy of the users are violated\n- LANs are restricted in size and cover only a limited area\n- Since all the data is stored in a single server computer, if it can be accessed by an unauthorized user, can cause a serious data\u00a0[security threat](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-security-threats).\n\n## **3\\. Campus Area Network (CAN)**\n\nCAN is bigger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN. This is a type of computer network that is usually used in places like a school or colleges. This network covers a limited geographical area that is, it spreads across several buildings within the campus. [CAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overview-of-campus-area-network-can/) mainly use Ethernet technology with a range from 1km to 5km. Its transmission speed is very high with a moderate maintenance cost and moderate cost. Examples of CAN are networks that cover schools, colleges, buildings, etc.\n\n![Campus Area Network (CAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230317132848/can.png)\n\nCampus Area Network (CAN)\n\n### **Advantages of CAN**\n\n- **Speed:** Communication within a CAN takes place over Local Area Network (LAN) so data transfer rate between systems is little bit fast than Internet.\n- **Security:** Network administrators of campus take care of network by continuous monitoring, tracking and limiting access. To protect network from unauthorized access firewall is placed between network and internet.\n- **Cost effective:** With a little effort and maintenance, network works well by providing fast data transfer rate with multi-departmental network access. It can be enabled wirelessly, where wiring and cabling costs can be managed. So to work with in a campus using CAN is cost-effective in view of performance\n\n## **4\\. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**\n\nA [MAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-full-form-in-computer-networking/) is larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN. This is the type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area. This network mainly uses FDDI, CDDI, and ATM as the technology with a range from 5km to 50km. Its transmission speed is average. It is difficult to maintain and it comes with a high cost. Examples of MAN are networking in towns, cities, a single large city, a large area within multiple buildings, etc.\n\n![Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230317133048/man.png)\n\nMetropolitan Area Network (MAN)\n\n### **Advantages of MAN**\n\n- MAN offers high-speed connectivity in which the speed ranges from 10-100 Mbps.\n- The security level in MAN is high and strict as compared to WAN.\n- It support to transmit data in both directions concurrently because of dual bus architecture.\n- MAN can serve multiple users at a time with the same high-speed internet to all the users.\n- MAN allows for centralized management and control of the network, making it easier to monitor and manage network resources and security.\n\n### **Disadvantages of MAN**\n\n- The architecture of MAN is quite complicated hence, it is hard to design and maintain.\n- This network is highly expensive because it required the high cost to set up fiber optics.\n- It provides less fault tolerance.\n- The Data transfer rate in MAN is low when compare to LANs.\n\n## **5\\. Wide Area Network (WAN)**\n\nWAN is a type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path. It is not restrained to a single location but extends over many locations. [WAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wan-full-form/) can also be defined as a group of local area networks that communicate with each other with a range above 50km. Here we use Leased-Line & Dial-up technology. Its transmission speed is very low and it comes with very high maintenance and very high cost. The most common example of WAN is the Internet.\n\n![Wide Area Network (WAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501212445/Screenshot209.png)\n\nWide Area Network (WAN)\n\n### Advantages of WAN\n\n- It covers large geographical area which enhances the reach of organisation to transmit data quickly and cheaply.\n- The data can be stored in centralised manner because of remote access to data provided by WAN.\n- The travel charges that are needed to cover the geographical area of work can be minimised.\n- WAN enables a user or organisation to connect with the world very easily and allows to exchange data and do business at global level.\n\n### Disadvantages of WAN\n\n- Traffic congestion in Wide Area Network is very high.\n- The fault tolerance ability of WAN is very less.\n- Noise and error are present in large amount due to multiple connection point.\n- The data transfer rate is slow in comparison to\u00a0LAN\u00a0because of large distances and high number of connected system within the network.\n\n## Comparison between Different Computer Networks\n\n| Parameters | PAN | LAN | CAN | MAN | WAN |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Full Name | Personal Area Network | Local Area Network | Campus Area Network | Metropolitan Area Network | Wide Area Network |\n| Technology | Bluetooth, IrDA,Zigbee | Ethernet & Wifi | Ethernet | FDDI, CDDi. ATM | Leased Line, Dial-Up |\n| Range | 1-100 m | Upto 2km | 1 \u2013 5 km | 5-50 km | Above 50 km |\n| Transmission Speed | Very High | Very High | High | Average | Low |\n| Ownership | Private | Private | Private | Private or Public | Private or Public |\n| Maintenance | Very Easy | Easy | Moderate | Difficult | Very Difficult |\n| Cost | Very Low | Low | Moderate | High | Very High |\n\n## Other Types of Computer Networks\n\n- Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)\n- Storage Area Network (SAN)\n- System-Area Network (SAN)\n- Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)\n- Enterprise Private Network (EPN)\n- Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n- Home Area Network (HAN)\n\n### **1\\. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)**\n\n[WLAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wlan-full-form/) is a type of computer network that acts as a local area network but makes use of wireless network technology like Wi-Fi. This network doesn\u2019t allow devices to communicate over physical cables like in LAN but allows devices to communicate wirelessly.\u00a0The most common example of WLAN is Wi-Fi.\n\n![Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501214003/Screenshot210.png)\n\nWireless Local Area Network (WLAN)\n\nThere are several computer networks available; more information is provided below.\n\n### **2\\. Storage Area Network (SAN)**\n\n[SAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-area-networks/) is a type of computer network that is high-speed and connects groups of storage devices to several servers. This network does not depend on LAN or WAN. Instead, a SAN moves the storage resources from the network to its high-powered network. A SAN provides access to block-level data storage. Examples of SAN are a network of disks accessed by a network of servers.\n\n![Storage Area Network (SAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501224107/Screenshot217.png)\n\nStorage Area Network (SAN)\n\n### **3\\. Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)**\n\nA POLAN is a type of computer network that is an alternative to a LAN. POLAN uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from a single strand of single-mode optical fiber to multiple signals to distribute users and devices. In short, POLAN is a point to multipoint LAN architecture.\n\n![Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501233609/Screenshot220.png)\n\nPassive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)\n\n### **4\\. Enterprise Private Network (EPN)**\n\nEPN is a type of computer network mostly used by businesses that want a secure connection over various locations to share computer resources.\n\n![Enterprise Private Network (EPN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210501235149/Screenshot221.png)\n\nEnterprise Private Network (EPN)\n\n### **5\\. Virtual Private Network (VPN)**\n\nA [VPN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-private-network-vpn-introduction/) is a type of computer network that extends a private network across the internet and lets the user send and receive data as if they were connected to a private network even though they are not. Through a virtual point-to-point connection users can access a private network remotely. VPN protects you from malicious sources by operating as a medium that gives you a protected network connection.\n\n![Virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210502002013/Screenshot224.png)\n\nVirtual Private Network (VPN)\n\n### **6\\. Home Area Network (HAN)**\n\nMany of the houses might have more than a computer. To interconnect those computers and with other peripheral devices, a network should be established similar to the local area network (LAN) within that home. Such a type of network that allows a user to interconnect multiple computers and other digital devices within the home is referred to as Home Area Network (HAN). [HAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-home-area-network-han/) encourages sharing of resources, files, and programs within the network. It supports both wired and wireless communication.\n\n![Home Area Network (HAN)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220124154803/HAN.PNG)\n\nHome Area Network (HAN)\n\n## Internetwork\n\nAn internet network\u00a0is defined as two or more computer network LANs, WANs, or computer network segments that are connected by devices and configured with a local addressing system. The method is known as internetworking. There are two types of Internetwork.\n\n- **Intranet**: An internal network within an organization that enables employees to share data, collaborate, and access resources.\u00a0Intranets are not accessible to the public and use private IP addresses.\n- **Extranet**: [Extranets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-extranet-definition-implementation-features/) extend the intranet to authorized external users, such as business partners or clients.\u00a0They provide controlled access to specific resources while maintaining security.\n\n## Advantages of Computer Network\n\n- **Central Storage of Data:** Files are stored on a central storage database which helps to easily access and available to everyone.\n- **Connectivity:** A single connection can be routed to connect multiple computing devices.\n- **Sharing of Files:** Files and data can be easily shared among multiple devices which helps in easily communicating among the organization.\n- **Security through Authorization:** Computer Networking provides additional security and protection of information in the system.\n\n## Disadvantages of Computer Network\n\n- **Virus and Malware:** A [virus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-computer-virus/) is a program that can infect other programs by modifying them. Viruses and [Malware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/malware-and-its-types/) can corrupt the whole network.\n- **High Cost of Setup:** The initial setup of Computer Networking is expensive because it consists of a lot of wires and cables along with the device.\n- **loss of Information:** In case of a System Failure, might lead to some loss of data.\n- **Management of Network:** Management of a Network is somehow complex for a person, it requires training for its proper use.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, computer networks are essential components that connect various computer devices in order to efficiently share data and resources. PAN, LAN, CAN, MAN, and WAN networks serve\u00a0a wide range of applications and purposes, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Understanding these networks and their applications improves connectivity, data exchange, and resource utilization in a variety of applications from personal use to global communications.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Types of Computer Network \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What are the types of service in CN?\n\n> - Internet and cloud connectivity.\n> - Branch office and campus connectivity.\n> - Private data center services.\n> - Secure cloud-connectivity services.\n> - Virtual network services.\n\n### What are the types of channel in CN?\n\n> - Simplex\n> - Half-Duplex\n> - Full-Duplex\n\n### What is WAN-as-a-service?\n\n> One type of cloud-based WAN model is WAN-as-a-service.

The community also can consist of serval gadgets/mediums that resource communique among or extra machines; those gadgets are called Network devices and consist of routers, switches, hubs, and bridges, amongst others.\n\n**Internet** is a group of computer systems connected from all around the world. The Internet protocol suite is a framework defined through the Internet standards. Methods are divided right into a layered set of protocols on this architecture. The Internet gives a huge variety of [statistics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/) and communique offerings, which includes forums, databases, email, and hypertext. It is made of the neighborhood to global personal, public networks connected through plenty of digital, wireless, and networking technologies.\n\n> The Internet is a worldwide interconnected network of hundreds of thousands of computers of various types that belong to multiple networks.\n\n**Working of** **the** **internet:** The internet is a global computer network that connects various devices and sends a lot of information and media. It uses an Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP)-based packet routing network. TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, regardless of the device or location. Data is delivered across the internet in the form of messages and packets. A message is a piece of data delivered over the internet, but before it is sent, it is broken down into smaller pieces known as packets.\n\nIP is a set of rules that control how data is transmitted from one computer to another via the internet. The IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred using a numerical address (IP Address). The TCP is used with IP to ensure that data is transferred in a secure and reliable manner. This ensures that no packets are lost, that packets are reassembled in the correct order, and that there is no delay that degrades data quality.\n\n**History of Internet**\n\nTalking about the [**history of internet**](https://news.geeksforgeeks.org/knowledge/history-of-internet), the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, later renamed the internet) established a successful link between the University of California Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute on October 29, 1969. Libraries automate and network catalogs outside of ARPANET in the late 1960s.\n\nTCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) is established in the 1970s, allowing internet technology to mature. The development of these protocols aided in the standardization of how data was sent and received via the internet. NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network), the 56 Kbps backbone of the internet, was financed by the National Science Foundation in 1986. Because government monies were being used to administer and maintain it, there were commercial restrictions in place at the time.\n\nIn the year 1991, a user-friendly internet interface was developed. Delphi was the first national commercial online service to offer internet connectivity in July 1992. Later in May 1995, All restrictions on commercial usage of the internet are lifted. As a result, the internet has been able to diversify and grow swiftly. Wi-Fi was first introduced in 1997. The year is 1998, and Windows 98 is released. Smartphone use is widespread in 2007. The 4G network is launched in 2009. The internet is used by 3 billion people nowadays. By 2030, there are expected to be 7.5 billion internet users and 500 billion devices linked to the internet.\n\n**Uses of the Internet:**\n\n- **E-mail:** E-mail is an electronic message sent across a network from one computer user to one or more recipients. It refers to the internet services in which messages are sent from and received by servers.\n- **Web Chat:** Web chat is an application that allows you to send and receive messages in real-time with others. By using Internet chat software, the user can log on to specific websites and talk with a variety of other users online. Chat software is interactive software that allows users to enter comments in one window and receive responses from others who are using the same software in another window.\n- **World Wide Web:** The World Wide Web is the Internet\u2019s most popular information exchange service. It provides users with access to a large number of documents that are linked together using hypertext or hyperlinks.\n- **E-commerce:** E-commerce refers to electronic business transactions made over the Internet. It encompasses a wide range of product and service-related online business activities.\n- **Internet telephony:** The technique that converts analog speech impulses into digital signals and routes them through packet-switched networks of the internet is known as internet telephony.\n- **Video conferencing:** The term \u201cvideo conferencing\u201d refers to the use of voice and images to communicate amongst users.\n\n**Web Client**\n\nThe client (or user) side of the Internet. The Web browser on the user\u2019s computer or mobile device is referred to as a Web client. It could also apply to browser extensions and helper software that improve the browser\u2019s ability to support specific site services.\n\n**Web browser**\n\nA web browser is a software program software that searches for, retrieves, and presentations material which includes Web pages, photos, videos, and different files. The browser sends a request to the Webserver, which then transmits the [statistics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/) returned to the browser, which presentations the findings at the laptop. Example \u2013 Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari etc.\n\n**Webpage**\n\nAn internet web page (additionally called a web page) is a report that may be regarded in an internet browser at the World Wide Web. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) are used to generate the primary shape of an internet web page. An internet web page is generally a segment of an internet site that carries statistics in plenty of formats, which includes textual content inside the shape of paragraphs, lists, tables, and so on.\n\nThe home web page is the beginning or first web page of an internet site. It gives trendy [statistics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/) and connections to all the internet pages which are associated. Every internet web page has its personal deal with. This may be visible withinside the deal with the bar. As a result, if we need to get admission to a selected internet web page, the deal needs to be placed inside the browser\u2019s deal with bar.\n\n**Website**\n\nAn internet site, in trendy, is a group of [statistics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/) approximately statistics prepared into many internet pages. An internet site is probably made for a sure motive, subject matter, or to provide a service. An internet site (abbreviated as \u201cwebsite\u201d or \u201csite\u201d) is a group of online pages connected collectively through links and saved on an internet server. By clicking on links, a tourist can pass from one web page to the next. An internet site\u2019s pages also are connected below one area call and proportion a not unusual place subject matter and template.\n\n**Search Engine**\n\nSearch engines are websites that search on the internet on behalf of users and show a listing of results. More than actually written may be discovered on seek engines. You can be capable of looking for different online content material which includes photographs, video content material, books, and news, in addition to gadgets and offerings, relying on the seek engine you are the use of.\n\nTo make use of the Internet, you do not always want to recognize the deal with an internet site. It is crucial to recognize the way to do a look for [statistics](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/statistics/). Using a seek engine is one of the only methods to seek. A seek engine can help you in finding what you are looking for. You also can appearance up net maps and instructions to help you to plot your adventure from one factor to some other. Example: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, yahoo, etc.\n\n**Web 1.0: The Beginning of the Internet**\n\nWeb 1.0, which emerged with the invention of the Internet, featured static web pages that could only be viewed. These early websites were essentially digital brochures, with limited interactivity and no ability for users to contribute content. This era saw the rise of early browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, which made it easier for users to access the Web.\n\n**Web 2.0: The Era of Social Media and User-Generated Content**\n\nWeb 2.0, which emerged during the \u201c _Internet Boom_\u201d era of the late 1990s and early 2000s, introduced more dynamic web pages and websites, and allowed for user-generated content. This era saw the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, as well as the introduction of blogs, wikis, and other forms of user-generated content.\n\n**Web 3.0: The Future of the Internet**\n\nWeb 3.0, which is still in development, promises to bring a more personalized and intuitive experience for users. It is expected to be more intelligent and able to understand the context and intent of the user\u2019s actions. This will be achieved through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies.\n\nMany experts in the tech industry claimed that Web 3.0 is the next evolution of the internet that is focused on decentralization, intelligence, and security. It aims to create a more personalized, intuitive, and inclusive experience for users by leveraging new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. The goal of Web 3.0 is to make the internet more democratic, open-source, and secure.\n\n**Differentiation between Network and Internet**\n\nThe number one distinction between a network and the internet is that a network is made of computer systems that are bodily related and may be used as a personal laptop at the same time as additionally sharing records. The Internet, on the alternative hand, might be an era that connects those small and massive networks and creates a brand new in-intensity community.\n\n**Advantages of the Internet:**\n\n- It is the best source of a wide range of information. There is no better place to conduct research than the internet.\n- Online gaming, talking, browsing, music, movies, dramas, and TV series are quickly becoming the most popular ways to pass the time.\n- Because there are hundreds of thousands of newsgroups and services that keep you updated with every tick of the clock, the Internet is a source of the most recent news.\n- Because of virtual shops where you may buy anything you want and need without leaving your house, internet shopping is becoming increasingly popular. Recently, virtual shops have been making a lot of money.\n- With the emergence of online businesses, virtual stores, and credit card usage, purchasing goods without going to the store has never been easier.\n\n**Disadvantages of the Internet:**\n\n- Spending too much time on the internet is hazardous for the young generation\u2019s physical and mental health.\n- Children who use the internet develop an addiction, which is quite dangerous.\n- It is now quite easy to decipher someone\u2019s chat or email messages thanks to the hacking community.\n- With the emergence of online stores, people prefer to order online rather than going to local stores which results in less social interactions among people.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-intranet/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is an Intranet?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-intranet/?ref=next_article)\n\n[K](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/khushboogoyal499/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[khushboogoyal499](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/khushboogoyal499/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Class 10](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/class-10/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-programming/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Fundamental Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis Computer Fundamental Tutorial covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, including computer hardware, software, operating systems, peripherals, etc. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, this tutorial is designed to enhance your computer skills and take them to the n\\\\\n\\\\\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-fundamentals-tutorial/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Introduction To Computer Fundamentals\n\n- [What is Computer?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA computer is an electronic device that can process and store information.

Its main objectives are to support safe staff communication, information archiving, and teamwork. Employees can create profiles, submit, like, comment on, and share posts using social intranet features that are common in contemporary intranets.\n\n## What is Intranet?\n\nAn intranet is a kind of private [network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-computer-networking/). For example, an intranet is used by different organizations and only members/staff of that organization have access to this. It is a system in which multiple computers of an organization (or the computers you want to connect) are connected through an intranet. As this is a private network, so no one from the outside world can access this network. So many organizations and companies have their intranet network and only its members and staff have access to this network. This is also used to protect your data and provide [data security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-security/) to a particular organization, as it is a private network and does not leak data to the outside world.\n\n## Working of Intranet\n\nAn intranet is a network confined to a company, school, or organization that works like the Internet. Let us understand more about the working of the intranet with the help of a diagram, as shown below:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210531165419/intranet-660x291.jpg)\n\nHere in this diagram, a company or an organization has created its private network or intranet for its work(intranet network is under the circle). The company or organization has many employees(in this diagram, we have considered 3). So, for their access, they have PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3(In the real world there are many employees as per the requirements of an organization). Also, they have their server for files or [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) to store, and to protect this private network, there is a [Firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/). This firewall protects and gives security to the intranet [server](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-server/) and its data from getting leaked to any unwanted user. So, a user who has access to the intranet can only access this network. So, no one from the outside world can access this network. Also, an intranet user can access the [internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-and-its-services/) but a person using the internet cannot access the intranet network.\n\n## Why is Intranet Important?\n\nIntranets play a crucial role in organizations by providing a centralized platform for seamless internal communication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing, thereby significantly enhancing productivity, streamlining operations, and fostering a culture of innovation and efficiency. Here are the reasons that increase its importance:\n\n- Improves internal communication\n- Connects employees across locations and time zones\n- Boosts recognition and reward\n- Simplifies employee onboarding\n- Provides organizational clarity\n- Encourages knowledge sharing\n\n## Features of Intranet\n\n- **Document management:**\u00a0The ability to store, organize, and share documents.\n- **Collaboration tools:**\u00a0The ability to collaborate on projects and tasks.\n- **News and announcements:**\u00a0The ability to share news and announcements with employees.\n- **Employee directory:**\u00a0The ability to find contact information for employees.\n- **Training and development:**\u00a0The ability to provide training and development resources to employees.\n- **HR resources:**\u00a0The ability to access HR-related information, such as benefits and policies.\n- **Support services:**\u00a0The ability to submit support tickets and get help from IT.\n\n## Advantages of Intranet\n\n- In the intranet, the cost of conveying data utilizing the intranet is very low.\n- Using intranet employees can easily get data anytime and anywhere.\n- It is easy to learn and use.\n- It can be utilized as a correspondence center point where employees can store data at whatever point they need and download files in just a few seconds.\n- It connects employees with each other.\n- The documents stored on the intranet are much more secure.\n\n## Disadvantages of Intranet\n\n- The expense of actualizing intranets is normally high.\n- The staff of the company or organization require special training to know how to use the system.\n- Data overloading.\n- Although the intranet provides good security, but it still lacks in some places.\n\n## Difference Between Intranet and Extranet\n\n\u201cWhat is Internet and how does it different from extranet\u201d this question might be aries into your mind when we study about Intranet, communication and networks. Here we discussed about it properly.\n\n| Internet | Externet |\n| --- | --- |\n| Internet is the private network that used for communication with in the organization. | extranet is an intranet that grants access to those outside of an organization to certain information and applications. |\n| Restricted to internal members of the organization. | Provides controlled access to external users, allowing them to interact with specific resources or information. |\n| Facilitates internal communication, collaboration, and information sharing among employees. | Supports collaboration and information exchange between an organization and its trusted external partners, suppliers, or customers. |\n| Typically has stronger security measures and access controls | Requires robust security measures to maintain data integrity and protect sensitive information shared with external parties. |\n\n## Difference Between Internet and Intranet\n\nAs we talk about the Intranet, it is too obvious to compare it with the Internet and for that, we have to look on the differences of both.\n\n| **Internet** | Intranet |\n| --- | --- |\n| Internet is available to all computers and everybody has access. | Intranet is limited and available to few computers(members who have access). |\n| The Internet has wider access and it provides access to a larger population with better access to its [websites](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-of-websites/). | Intranet is restricted. |\n| The internet is not as safe as Intranet. | Intranet is safe and secure when it comes to data security and Intranet can be safely privatized as per the user requirement |\n\n## Similarities Between the Internet and Intranet\n\nAs we talk about the Intranet, it is too obvious to compare it with the Internet and for that, we have to look on the similarities of both.\n\n| Internet | Intranet |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/) and [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp/) are the protocol of Internet. | Intranet uses TCP/IP and FTP . |\n| internet sites are accessible to all and intranet hosted sites are available only to its members or staff\u2019s with access. | Via [web browser](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-browser/) Intranet sites are accessible in the same as internet sites are accessible. |\n| There is yahoo messenger or Gtalk available on the internet | Similarly, There is own instant messenger available in Intranet. |\n\n## Uses of Intranet\n\nAn intranet software is mainly used by organizations as a tool :\n\n- Intranet share organizational updates.\n- Intranets become the center repository where important information. news and company data are stored. We can store files using intranet.\n- Easy to communicate with employees. They create employee directories and organization charts readily available, improving internal corporate communications. Intranet connect employees of the organization\n- Easy to access information. Using intranet collaborate with teams across borders\n- Productivity increase using Intranet.\n- Give employees a voice in the organization\n\n## Examples of Intranets\n\nHere are some popular examples of intranet software used by various organizations across the globe:\n\n- **Microsoft SharePoint**\n- **Google Workspace**\n- **Zoho Connect**\n- **Confluence**\n- **Joomla**\n- **Drupal**\n\n## FAQs on Intranet\n\n### 1\\. Can intranet\u00a0work\u00a0without Internet?\n\n> The fundamental technology that makes intranet connectivity possible is the Internet. Internal and intranet are typically kept separate to protect the security of the intranet. Employee computers must be connected to [local area network(LAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) of company in order to access the intranet. These computers must be filled with web browser software, such as [Safari, Firefox](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/safari-vs-firefox/), or Internet Explorer. for security act as gatekeepers, firewalls are set up.\n\n### 2\\. What is the purpose of Intranet?\n\n> An organization may employ an intranet for a variety of reasons. An intranet is primarily utilized for productivity. Its goals are to foster internal communication, enable cooperation, and link staff. An intranet can help organizations overcome social barriers, among other issues, depending on their organizational structure.\n\n### 3\\. What is an intranet site?\n\n> An intranet can be thought of as staff website of a company that is not available to the general public via the Internet. Imagine an intranet as a space where staff members may \u201ce-meet,\u201d connect, collaborate, engage with the company, and get to know one another. Features popularized by well-known social networks are introduced in a social intranet.\n\n### 4\\. Who can access the intranet network?\n\n> Members who have access to this intranet network. because intranet are used by different organizations and only members/staff of that organization have the access to this.\n\n### 5\\. Why intranet is more secured and safe, when it comes to data security?\n\n> Intranet is safe and secure when it comes to data security, because intranet can be safely privatized as per the user requirement hereas the internet is not safe as Intranet.\n\n### 6\\. Which task can a company perform with intranets\n\n> A company can utilize intranets to accomplish a wide range of tasks. Below are some examples of the tasks that can be performed using intranets. The specific features and functionalities may differ based on the intranet platform and the company\u2019s requirements.\n>\n> 1. Internal Communication\n> 2. Document Management\n> 3. Knowledge Sharing\n> 4. Employee Self-Service\n> 5. Training and Development\n> 6. Task and Project Management\n> 7.

Common types of network topology include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree topologies, each with its advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will discuss different types of network topology in detail.\n\n## What is Network Topology?\n\nNetwork topology is the way devices are connected in a network. It defines how these components are connected and how data transfer between the network. Understanding the different types of network topologies can help in choosing the right design for a specific network.\n\nThere are two major categories of Network Topology i.e. Physical Network topology and Logical Network Topology. Physical Network Topology refers to the actual structure of the physical medium for the transmission of data. Logical network Topology refers to the transmission of data between devices present in the network irrespective of the way devices are connected. The structure of the network is important for the proper functioning of the network. one must choose the most suitable topology as per their requirement.\n\n## Types of Network Topology\n\nBelow mentioned are the types of Network Topology\n\n- [Point to Point Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-point-to-point-link-and-star-topology-network/)\n- [Mesh Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantage-and-disadvantage-of-mesh-topology/)\n- [Star Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/)\n- [Bus Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/)\n- [Ring Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-ring-topology/)\n- [Tree Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-tree-topology/)\n- [Hybrid Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hybrid-topology/)\n\n## Point to Point Topology\n\nPoint-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth.\n\n![Point-to-point-topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240614235231/Point-to-point-topology.png)\n\nPoint to Point Topology\n\n## Mesh Topology\n\nIn a mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via a particular channel. Every device is connected to another via dedicated channels. These channels are known as links. In Mesh Topology, the protocols used are AHCP (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocols), [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/)(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), etc.\n\n![Mesh-Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241028174648312121/Mesh-Topology.png)\n\nMesh Topology\n\n- Suppose, the N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, the total number of ports that are required by each device is N-1. In Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of ports required by each device is 4. The total number of ports required = N \\* (N-1).\n- Suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, then the total number of dedicated links required to connect them is N  C  2  i.e. N(N-1)/2. In Figure 1, there are 5 devices connected to each other, hence the total number of links required is 5\\*4/2 = 10.\n\n### **Advantages of Mesh Topology**\n\n- Communication is very fast between the nodes.\n- Mesh Topology is robust.\n- The fault is diagnosed easily. Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.\n- Provides security and privacy.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Mesh Topology**\n\n- Installation and configuration are difficult.\n- The cost of cables is high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for less number of devices.\n- The cost of maintenance is high.\n\nA common example of mesh topology is the internet backbone, where various internet service providers are connected to each other via dedicated channels. This topology is also used in military communication systems and aircraft navigation systems.\n\n## Star Topology\n\nIn Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node. The hub can be passive in nature i.e., not an intelligent hub such as broadcasting devices, at the same time the hub can be intelligent known as an active hub. Active hubs have repeaters in them. Coaxial cables or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers. In Star Topology, many popular [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/) LAN protocols are used as CD(Collision Detection), [CSMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma/) (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), etc.\n\n![Star-Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241028174732747554/Star-Topology.png)\n\nStar Topology\n\n### **Advantages of Star Topology**\n\n- If N devices are connected to each other in a star topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is N. So, it is easy to set up.\n- Each device requires only 1 port i.e. to connect to the hub, therefore the total number of ports required is N.\n- It is Robust. If one link fails only that link will affect and not other than that.\n- Easy to fault identification and fault isolation.\n- Star topology is cost-effective as it uses inexpensive coaxial cable.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Star Topology**\n\n- If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.\n- The cost of installation is high.\n- Performance is based on the single concentrator i.e. hub.\n\nA common example of star topology is a **local area network (LAN)** in an office where all computers are connected to a central hub. This topology is also used in wireless networks where all devices are connected to a wireless access point.\n\n## Bus Topology\n\nBus Topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It is bi-directional.\u00a0It is a multi-point connection and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes. In Bus Topology, various [MAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) (Media Access Control) protocols are followed by LAN ethernet connections like [TDMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fdma-tdma-and-cdma/), [Pure Aloha](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pure-aloha/), CDMA, [Slotted Aloha](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-slotted-aloha/), etc.\n\n![Bus Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/3-55.png)\n\nBus Topology\n\n### **Advantages of Bus Topology**\n\n- If N devices are connected to each other in a bus topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is 1, known as backbone cable, and N drop lines are required.\n- Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support up to 10 Mbps.\n- The cost of the cable is less compared to other topologies, but it is used to build small networks.\n- Bus topology is familiar technology as installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known.\n- [CSMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma) is the most common method for this type of topology.\n\n### **Disadvantages of \u00a0Bus Topology**\n\n- A bus topology is quite simpler, but still, it requires a lot of cabling.\n- If the common cable fails, then the whole system will crash down.\n- If the network traffic is heavy, it increases collisions in the network. To avoid this, various protocols are used in the MAC layer known as Pure Aloha, Slotted Aloha, CSMA/CD, etc.\n- Adding new devices to the network would slow down networks.\n- Security is very low.\n\nA common example of bus topology is the Ethernet LAN, where all devices are connected to a single coaxial cable or twisted pair cable. This topology is also used in cable television networks.\n\n## Ring Topology\n\nIn a Ring Topology, it forms a ring connecting devices with exactly two neighboring devices. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes, because if someone wants to send some data to the last node in the ring topology with 100 nodes, then the data will have to pass through 99 nodes to reach the 100th node. Hence to prevent data loss repeaters are used in the network.\n\nThe data flows in one direction, i.e. it is unidirectional, but it can be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called\u00a0Dual Ring Topology. In-Ring Topology, the Token Ring Passing protocol is used by the workstations to transmit the data.\n\n![Ring Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241028175715256679/Untitled-Diagram-153-1.jpg)\n\nRing Topology\n\nThe most common access method of ring topology is token passing.\n\n- **Token passing:** It is a network access method in which a token is passed from one node to another node.\n- **Token:** It is a frame that circulates around the network.\n\n### **Operations of Ring Topology**\n\n- One station is known as a **monitor** station which takes all the responsibility for performing the operations.\n- To transmit the data, the station has to hold the token. After the transmission is done, the token is to be released for other stations to use.\n- When no station is transmitting the data, then the token will circulate in the ring.\n- There are two types of token release techniques: **Early token release** releases the token just after transmitting the data and **Delayed token release** releases the token after the acknowledgment is received from the receiver.\n\n### **Advantages of Ring Topology**\n\n- The data transmission is high-speed.\n- The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.\n- Cheap to install and expand.\n- It is less costly than a star topology.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Ring Topology**\n\n- The failure of a single node in the network can cause the entire network to fail.\n- Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.\n- The addition of stations in between or the removal of stations can disturb the whole topology.\n- Less secure.\n\n## **Tree Topology**\n\nTree topology is the variation of the Star topology. This topology has a hierarchical flow of data.\u00a0In Tree Topology, protocols like [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/) and **SAC (Standard Automatic Configuration)** are used.\n\n![Tree-topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240614234036/Tree-topology.png)\n\nTree Topology\n\nIn tree topology, the various secondary hubs are connected to the central hub which contains the repeater. This data flow from top to bottom i.e. from the central hub to the secondary and then to the devices or from bottom to top i.e. devices to the secondary hub and then to the central hub.\u00a0It is a [multi-point connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-point-to-point-and-multi-point-communication/) and a non-robust topology because if the backbone fails the topology crashes.\n\n### **Advantages of Tree Topology**\n\n- It allows more devices to be attached to a single central hub thus it decreases the distance that is traveled by the signal to come to the devices.\n- It allows the network to get isolated and also prioritize from different computers.\n- We can add **new devices to the existing network.**\n- **Error detection** and **error correction** are very easy in a tree topology.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Tree Topology**\n\n- If the central hub gets fails the entire system fails.\n- The cost is high because of the cabling.\n- If new devices are added, it becomes difficult to reconfigure.\n\nA common example of a tree topology is the hierarchy in a large organization. At the top of the tree is the CEO, who is connected to the different departments or divisions (child nodes) of the company. Each department has its own hierarchy, with managers overseeing different teams (grandchild nodes). The team members (leaf nodes) are at the bottom of the hierarchy, connected to their respective managers and departments.\n\n## Hybrid Topology\n\nHybrid Topology is the combination of all the various types of topologies we have studied above. Hybrid Topology is used when the nodes are free to take any form. It means these can be individuals such as Ring or Star topology or can be a combination of various types of topologies seen above. Each individual topology uses the protocol that has been discussed earlier.\n\n![Hybrid-Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240615002149/Hybrid-Topology.png)\n\nHybrid Topology\n\nThe above figure shows the structure of the Hybrid topology. As seen it contains a combination of all different types of networks.\n\n### **Advantages of Hybrid Topology**\n\n- This topology is **very flexible** .\n- The size of the network can be easily expanded by **adding new devices.**\n\n### **Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology**\n\n- It is challenging **to design the architecture** of the Hybrid Network.\n- **Hubs** used in this topology are **very expensive.**\n- The infrastructure cost is very high as a hybrid network **requires a lot of cabling and network devices** .\n\nA common example of a hybrid topology is a university campus network. The network may have a backbone of a star topology, with each building connected to the backbone through a switch or router. Within each building, there may be a bus or ring topology connecting the different rooms and offices. The wireless access points also create a mesh topology for wireless devices. This hybrid topology allows for efficient communication between different buildings while providing flexibility and redundancy within each building.\n\n## Why is Network Topology Important?\n\nNetwork Topology is important because it defines how devices are connected and how they communicate in the network. Here are some points that defines why network topology is important.\n\n- **Network Performance:** Upon choosing the appropriate topology as per requirement, it helps in running the network easily and hence increases network performance.\n- **Network Reliability:** Some topologies like Star, Mesh are reliable as if one connection fails, they provide an alternative for that connection, hence it works as a backup.\n- **Network Expansion** : Chosing correct topology helps in easier expansion of Network as it helps in adding more devices to the network without disrupting the actual network.\n- **Network Security:** Network Topology helps in understanding how devices are connected and hence provides a better security to the network.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, network topologies play a crucial role in determining the efficiency and reliability of a computer network. Each topology, whether it\u2019s bus, star, ring, mesh, or tree, offers unique benefits and potential drawbacks. By understanding these different arrangements, network designers can choose the most appropriate topology to meet the specific needs of their systems, ensuring optimal performance and connectivity.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Types of Network Topology \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Which topology is best for large networks?\n\n> For large networks, mesh and tree topologies are often preferred.

Network devices like hubs, repeaters, bridges, switches, routers, gateways, and brouter help manage and direct data flow in a network. They ensure efficient communication between connected devices by controlling data transfer, boosting signals, and linking different networks. Each device serves a specific role, from simple data forwarding to complex routing between networks. In this article, we are going to discuss different types of network devices in detail.\n\n![Common-Types-of-Network-Devices-1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241014175346235579/Common-Types-of-Network-Devices-1.png)\n\nTypes of Network Devices\n\n## Functions of Network Devices\n\n- Network devices help to send and receive data between different devices.\n- Network devices allow devices to connect to the network efficiently and securely.\n- Network devices improves network speed and manage data flow better.\n- It protects the network by controlling access and preventing threats.\n- Expand the network range and solve signal problems.\n\n## Common Types of Networking Devices and Their Uses\n\nNetwork devices work as a mediator between two devices for transmission of data, and thus play a very important role in the functioning of a computer network. Below are some common network devices used in modern networks:\n\n- Access Point\n- Modems\n- Firewalls\n- Repeater\n- Hub\n- Bridge\n- Switch\n- Routers\n- Gateway\n- Brouter\n- NIC\n\n## Access Point\n\nAn [access point](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-wireless-access-point/) in networking is a device that allows wireless devices, like smartphones and laptops, to connect to a wired network. It creates a Wi-Fi network that lets wireless devices communicate with the internet or other devices on the network. Access points are used to extend the range of a network or provide Wi-Fi in areas that do not have it. They are commonly found in homes, offices, and public places to provide wireless internet access.\n\n## Modems\n\n[Modem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-modem/) is also known as modulator/demodulator is a network device that is used to convert [digital signal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-digital-signals/) into [analog signals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-analog-and-digital-signal/) of different frequencies and transmits these signals to a modem at the receiving location. These converted signals can be transmitted over the cable systems, telephone lines, and other communication mediums. A modem is also used to convert an analog signal back into digital signal. Modems are generally used to access the internet by customers of an [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/isp-full-form/).\n\n### **Types of Modems**\n\nThere are four main types of modems:\n\n- **DSL Modem**: Uses regular phone lines to connect to the internet but it is slower compared to other types.\n- **Cable Modem**: Sends data through TV cables, providing faster internet than [DSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-subscriber-line-dsl/).\n- **Wireless Modem**: Connects devices to the internet using [Wi-Fi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-wi-fiwireless-fidelity/) relying on nearby Wi-Fi signals.\n- **Cellular Modem**: Connects to the internet using mobile data from a cellular network not Wi-Fi or fixed cables.\n\n## Firewalls\n\nA [firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/) is a network security device that monitors and controls the flow of data between your computer or network and the internet. It acts as a barrier, blocking unauthorized access while allowing trusted data to pass through. Firewalls help protect your network from hackers, viruses, and other online [threats](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-security-threats/) by filtering traffic based on security rules. Firewalls can be physical devices (hardware), programs (software), or even cloud-based services, which can be offered as [SaaS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-as-a-service-saas/), through public clouds, or private virtual clouds.\n\n## Repeater\n\nA [repeater](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/repeaters-in-computer-network/) operates at the [physical layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/). Its main function is to amplify (i.e., regenerate) the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network. When the signal becomes weak, they copy it bit by bit and regenerate it at its star topology connectors connecting following the original strength. It is a 2-port device.\n\n## **Hub**\n\nA [hub](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-hub-and-how-it-works/) is a multiport repeater.\u00a0A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in [star topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/) which connects different stations. Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices.\u00a0 In other words, the collision domain of all hosts connected through Hub remains one.\u00a0 Also, they do not have the intelligence to find out the best path for data packets which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.\n\n### **Types of Hub**\n\n- **Active Hub:** These are the hubs that have their power supply and can clean, boost, and relay the signal along with the network. It serves both as a repeater as well as a wiring center. These are used to extend the maximum distance between nodes.\n\n- **Passive Hub:** These are the hubs that collect wiring from nodes and power supply from the active hub. These hubs relay signals onto the network without cleaning and boosting them and can\u2019t be used to extend the distance between nodes.\n\n- **Intelligent Hub:** It works like an active hub and includes remote management capabilities. They also provide flexible data rates to network devices. It also enables an administrator to monitor the traffic passing through the hub and to configure each port in the hub.\n\n## **Bridge**\n\nA [bridge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bridge-and-repeater/) operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the [MAC addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) of the source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol. It typically connects multiple network segments and each port is connected to different segment. A bridge is not strictly limited to two ports, it can have multiple ports to connect and manage multiple network segments. Modern multi-port bridges are often called Layer 2 switches because they perform similar functions.\n\n### **Types of Bridges**\n\n- **Transparent Bridges:** These are the bridge in which the stations are completely unaware of the\u00a0bridge\u2019s existence i.e. whether or not a bridge is added or deleted from the network, reconfiguration of\u00a0the stations is unnecessary. These bridges make use of two processes i.e. bridge forwarding and bridge learning.\n\n- **Source Routing Bridges:** In these bridges, routing operations is performed by the source station and the frame specifies which route to follow. The host can discover the frame by sending a special frame called the discovery frame, which spreads through the entire network using all possible paths to the destination.\n\n## **Switch**\n\nA [switch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-switches-in-computer-network/) is a multiport bridge with a buffer designed that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. A switch is a data link layer device.\u00a0The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, which makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to the correct port only.\u00a0 In other words, the switch divides the [collision domain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collision-domain-and-broadcast-domain-in-computer-network/) of hosts, but the [broadcast domain](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-broadcast-domain/) remains the same.\n\n### **Types of \u00a0Switch**\n\n- **Unmanaged Switches:** These switches have a simple plug-and-play design and do not offer advanced configuration options. They are suitable for small networks or for use as an expansion to a larger network.\n\n- **Managed Switches:** These switches offer advanced configuration options such as [VLANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-lan-vlan/), [QoS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-quality-of-service-qos-and-quality-of-experience-qoe/), and link aggregation. They are suitable for larger, more complex networks and allow for centralized management.\n\n- **Smart Switches:** These switches have features similar to managed switches but are typically easier to set up and manage. They are suitable for small- to medium-sized networks.\n\n- **Layer 2 Switches:** These switches operate at the Data Link layer of the [OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) and are responsible for forwarding data between devices on the same network segment.\n\n- **Layer 3 switches:** These switches operate at the Network layer of the OSI model and can route data between different network segments. They are more advanced than [Layer 2 switches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-layer-2-and-layer-3-switches/) and are often used in larger, more complex networks.\n\n- **PoE Switches**: These switches have Power over [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/) capabilities, which allows them to supply power to network devices over the same cable that carries data.\n\n- **Gigabit switches:** These switches support Gigabit Ethernet speeds, which are faster than traditional Ethernet speeds.\n\n- **Rack-Mounted Switches:** These switches are designed to be mounted in a server rack and are suitable for use in data centers or other large networks.\n\n- **Desktop Switches:** These switches are designed for use on a desktop or in a small office environment and are typically smaller in size than rack-mounted switches.\n\n- **Modular Switches**: These switches have modular design that allows for easy expansion or customization. They are suitable for large networks and data centers.\n\n## **Router**\n\nA [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. The router is mainly a Network Layer device. Routers normally connect LANs and [WANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wan-full-form/) and have a dynamically updating [routing table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets. The router divides the broadcast domains of hosts connected through it.\n\n## **Gateway**\n\nA [gateway](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-gateway-and-modem/), as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks that may work upon different networking models. They work as messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it, and transfer it to another system. Gateways are also called protocol converters and can operate at any network layer. Gateways are generally more complex than switches or routers.\n\n## **Brouter**\n\nIt is also known as the bridging router is a device that combines features of both bridge and router. It can work either at the [data link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/) or a [network layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-in-osi-model/). Working as a router, it is capable of routing packets across networks and working as a bridge, it is capable of filtering local area network traffic.\n\n## **NIC**\n\nNIC or [network interface card](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nic-full-form/) is a network adapter that is used to connect the computer to the network. It is installed in the computer to establish a [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/). \u00a0It has a unique ID that is written on the chip, and it has a connector to connect the cable to it. The cable acts as an interface between the computer and the router or modem. NIC is a layer 2 device which means that it works on both the physical and data link layers of the network model.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, different types of network devices play essential roles in keeping a network running smoothly and securely. Devices like routers, switches, modems, and access points help connect devices, manage data traffic, and ensure efficient communication. Firewalls add a layer of security, while other tools extend the network\u2019s reach or make it easier to manage. Each device has a specific function, but together they create a reliable and secure network environment for both personal and business use.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Network Devices \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Why do we need network devices?**\n\n> Network devices are necessary to connect computers, manage data traffic, extend internet access, and ensure secure and efficient communication within a network.\n\n### **What does a modem do?**\n\n> A modem connects your network to the internet by converting data between digital signals (used by devices) and analog signals (used by the internet provider).\n\n### **What is the difference between a switch and a hub?**\n\n> A switch sends data only to the specific device that needs it, while a hub sends data to all connected devices, which can slow down the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-network-attacks-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Basic Network Attacks in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-network-attacks-in-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n351\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[TCP Congestion Control\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nTCP congestion control is a method used by the TCP protocol to manage data flow over a network and prevent congestion.

OSI Model was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. The OSI Model consists of 7 layers and each layer has specific functions and responsibilities. This layered approach makes it easier for different devices and technologies to work together. OSI Model provides a clear structure for data transmission and managing network issues. The OSI Model is widely used as a reference to understand how network systems function.\n\n![OSI-Model-.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545142665/OSI-Model-.webp)![OSI-Model-.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545142665/OSI-Model-.webp)\n\n![Application-layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544667663/Application-layer.webp)![Application-layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544667663/Application-layer.webp)\n\n![Presentation-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545669544/Presentation-Layer.webp)![Presentation-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545669544/Presentation-Layer.webp)\n\n![Session-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545829871/Session-Layer.webp)![Session-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545829871/Session-Layer.webp)\n\n![Transport-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545963854/Transport-Layer.webp)![Transport-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545963854/Transport-Layer.webp)\n\n![network_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544995131/network_layer.webp)![network_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544995131/network_layer.webp)\n\n![data_link_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544840510/data_link_layer.webp)![data_link_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112544840510/data_link_layer.webp)\n\n![Physical-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545532032/Physical-Layer.webp)![Physical-Layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117112545532032/Physical-Layer.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 8\n\n## Layers of the OSI Model\n\nThere are 7 layers in the OSI Model and each layer has its specific role in handling data. All the layers are mentioned below:\n\n- [Physical Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer)\n- [Network Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-in-osi-model/)\n- [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-in-osi-model/)\n- [Session Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model)\n- [Presentation Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model)\n- [Application Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model)\n\n## **Layer 1 \u2013 Physical Layer**\n\nThe lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the **Physical Layer**. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. The physical layer contains information in the form of **bits.** Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next. When receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together. Common physical layer devices are [Hub](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-hub-and-how-it-works/), [Repeater](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/repeaters-in-computer-network/), [Modem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-modem-and-router/), and [Cables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-ethernet-cable/).\n\n![physical-layer-in-OSI](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241015103017414021/physical-layer.png)\n\nPhysical Layer\n\n### Functions of the Physical Layer\n\n- **Bit Synchronization:** The physical layer provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at the bit level.\n- **Bit Rate Control:** The Physical layer also defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.\n- **Physical Topologies:** Physical layer specifies how the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network i.e. [bus topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/), [star topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/), or [mesh topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantage-and-disadvantage-of-mesh-topology/).\n- **Transmission Mode:** Physical layer also defines how the data flows between the two connected devices. The various transmission modes possible are [Simplex, half-duplex and](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-simplex-half-duplex-and-full-duplex-transmission-modes/) full duplex.\n\n## **Layer 2 \u2013 Data Link Layer (DLL)**\n\nThe data link layer is responsible for the node-to-node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error-free from one node to another, over the physical layer. When a packet arrives in a network, it is the responsibility of the DLL to transmit it to the Host using its [MAC address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network). Packet in the Data Link layer is referred to as Frame **.** [Switches and Bridges](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-switch-and-bridge/) are common Data Link Layer devices.\n\nThe Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:\n\n- [Logical Link Control (LLC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-link-control-llc-protocol-data-unit)\n- [Media Access Control (MAC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-mac-address-in-computer-network)\n\nThe packet received from the Network layer is further divided into frames depending on the frame size of the **NIC (** [**Network Interface Card)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nic-full-form/). DLL also encapsulates Sender and Receiver\u2019s MAC address in the header.\n\nThe Receiver\u2019s MAC address is obtained by placing an ARP ( [Address Resolution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works) Protocol) request onto the wire asking, \u201cWho has that IP address?\u201d and the destination host will reply with its MAC address.\n\n### Functions of the Data Link Layer\n\n- **Framing:** Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.\n- **Physical Addressing:** After creating frames, the Data link layer adds physical addresses (MAC **addresses)** of the sender and/or receiver in the header of each frame.\n- **Error Control:** The data link layer provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmits damaged or lost frames.\n- **Flow Control:** The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgment.\n- **Access Control:** When a single communication channel is shared by multiple devices, the MAC sub-layer of the data link layer helps to determine which device has control over the channel at a given time.\n\n## **Layer 3 \u2013 Network Layer**\n\nThe network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available. The sender and receiver\u2019s IP [address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address) are placed in the header by the network layer. Segment in the Network layer is referred to as Packet **.** Network layer is implemented by networking devices such as [routers and switches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-router-and-switch/).\n\n### Functions of the Network Layer\n\n- **Routing:** The network layer protocols determine which route is suitable from source to destination. This function of the network layer is known as routing.\n- **Logical Addressing:** To identify each device inter-network uniquely, the network layer defines an addressing scheme. The sender and receiver\u2019s IP addresses are placed in the header by the network layer. Such an address distinguishes each device uniquely and universally.\n\n## **Layer 4 \u2013 Transport Layer**\n\nThe transport layer provides services to the application layer and takes services from the network layer. The data in the transport layer is referred to as **Segments**. It is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of the complete message. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found. Protocols used in Transport Layer are [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/), [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) [NetBIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-netbios-enumeration/), [PPTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pptp-full-form/).\n\n**At the sender\u2019s side**, the transport layer receives the formatted data from the upper layers, performs **Segmentation**, and also implements **Flow and error control** to ensure proper data transmission. It also adds Source and Destination [port number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ports-in-networking) in its header and forwards the segmented data to the Network Layer.\n\n- Generally, this destination port number is configured, either by default or manually. For example, when a web application requests a web server, it typically uses port number 80, because this is the default port assigned to web applications. Many applications have default ports assigned.\n\n**At the Receiver\u2019s side,** Transport Layer reads the port number from its header and forwards the Data which it has received to the respective application. It also performs sequencing and reassembling of the segmented data.\n\n### Functions of the Transport Layer\n\n- **Segmentation and Reassembly:** This layer accepts the message from the (session) layer and breaks the message into smaller units. Each of the segments produced has a header associated with it. The transport layer at the destination station reassembles the message.\n- **Service Point Addressing:** To deliver the message to the correct process, the transport layer header includes a type of address called service point address or port address. Thus, by specifying this address, the transport layer makes sure that the message is delivered to the correct process.\n\n### Services\u00a0Provided by Transport Layer\n\n- [Connection-Oriented Service](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connection-oriented-service)\n- [Connectionless Service](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connection-less-service)\n\n## **Layer 5 \u2013 Session Layer**\n\nSession Layer in the OSI Model is responsible for the establishment of connections, management of connections, terminations of sessions between two devices. It also provides authentication and security. Protocols used in the Session Layer are NetBIOS, PPTP.\n\n### Functions of the Session Layer\n\n- **Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination:** The layer allows the two processes to establish, use, and terminate a connection.\n- **Synchronization:** This layer allows a process to add checkpoints that are considered synchronization points in the data. These synchronization points help to identify the error so that the data is re-synchronized properly, and ends of the messages are not cut prematurely, and data loss is avoided.\n- **Dialog Controller:** The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full duplex.\n\n**Example**\n\nLet us consider a scenario where a user wants to send a message through some Messenger application running in their browser. The \u201c **Messenger**\u201d here acts as the application layer which provides the user with an interface to create the data. This message or so-called **Data** is compressed, optionally encrypted (if the data is sensitive), and converted into bits (0\u2019s and 1\u2019s) so that it can be transmitted.\n\n![Communication in Session Layer](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230405124947/communication.jpg)\n\nCommunication in Session Layer\n\n## **Layer 6 \u2013 Presentation Layer**\n\nThe presentation layer is also called the **Translation layer**. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. Protocols used in the Presentation Layer are [JPEG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-jpeg-and-png/), [MPEG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mpeg-full-form/), [GIF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-gif-file/), [TLS/SSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/), etc.\n\n### Functions of the Presentation Layer\n\n- **Translation:** For example, [ASCII to EBCDIC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ascii-and-ebcdic).\n- **Encryption/ Decryption:** Data encryption translates the data into another form or code. The encrypted data is known as the ciphertext, and the decrypted data is known as plain text. A key value is used for encrypting as well as decrypting data.\n- **Compression:** Reduces the number of bits that need to be transmitted on the network.\n\n## **Layer 7 \u2013 Application Layer**\n\nAt the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the network and for displaying the received information to the user. Protocols used in the Application layer are [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/), [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-in-application-layer/), [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/), etc.\n\n![application-layer-in-OSI](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241015103102290937/application-layer.gif)\n\nApplication Layer\n\n### Functions of the Application Layer\n\nThe main functions of the application layer are given below.\n\n- **Network Virtual Terminal (NVT):** It allows a user to log on to a remote host.\n- **File Transfer Access and Management (FTAM):** This application allows a user to access files in a remote host, retrieve files in a remote host, and manage or control files from a remote computer.\n- **Mail Services:** Provide email service.\n- **Directory Services:** This application provides distributed database sources and access for global information about various objects and services.\n\n## How Data Flows in the OSI Model **?**\n\nWhen we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender\u2019s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver\u2019s end.\n\nData flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:\n\n- **Application Layer:** Applications create the data.\n- **Presentation Layer:** Data is formatted and encrypted.\n- **Session Layer:** Connections are established and managed.\n- **Transport Layer:** Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.\n- **Network Layer:** Segments are packaged into packets and routed.\n- **Data Link Layer:** Packets are framed and sent to the next device.\n- **Physical Layer:** Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.\n\nEach layer adds specific information to ensure the data reaches its destination correctly, and these steps are reversed upon arrival.\n\n![Osi-model-1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345083198/Osi-model-1.webp)![Osi-model-1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345083198/Osi-model-1.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345255193/OSI-model-2.webp)![OSI-model-2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345255193/OSI-model-2.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345396616/OSI-model-3.webp)![OSI-model-3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345396616/OSI-model-3.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345549125/OSI-model-4.webp)![OSI-model-4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345549125/OSI-model-4.webp)\n\n![osi_model_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113346159409/osi_model_5.webp)![osi_model_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113346159409/osi_model_5.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345698018/OSI-model-6.webp)![OSI-model-6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345698018/OSI-model-6.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345851034/OSI-model-7.webp)![OSI-model-7.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113345851034/OSI-model-7.webp)\n\n![OSI-model-8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113346005466/OSI-model-8.webp)![OSI-model-8.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117113346005466/OSI-model-8.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 8\n\nWe can understand how data flows through OSI Model with the help of an example mentioned below.\n\nLet us suppose, **Person A** sends an e-mail to his friend **Person B**.\n\n**Step 1: Person A** interacts with e-mail application like **Gmail**, **outlook**, etc. Writes his email to send. (This happens at **Application Layer**).\n\n**Step 2: At Presentation Layer,** Mail application prepares for data transmission like encrypting data and formatting it for transmission.\n\n**Step 3: At Session Layer,** there is a connection established between the sender and receiver on the internet.\n\n**Step 4: At Transport Layer**, Email data is broken into smaller segments. It adds sequence number and error-checking information to maintain the reliability of the information.\n\n**Step 5: At Network Layer,** addressing of packets is done in order to find the best route for transfer.\n\n**Step 6: At Data Link Layer, d** ata packets are encapsulated into frames, then MAC address is added for local devices and then it checks for error using error detection.\n\n**Step 7: At Physical Layer,** Frames are transmitted in the form of electrical/ optical signals over a physical network medium like ethernet cable or WiFi.\n\nAfter the email reaches the receiver i.e. **Person B**, the process will reverse and decrypt the e-mail content. At last, the email will be shown on **Person B** email client.\n\nPlease refer the below animation for detailed flow.\n\n![OSI-Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)\n\n## **Protocols Used in the OSI Layers**\n\n| Layer | Working | Protocol Data Unit | Protocols |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **1 \u2013 Physical Layer** | Establishing Physical Connections between Devices. | Bits | [USB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/universal-serial-bus-usb/), [SONET/SDH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-sonet-and-sdh/), etc. |\n| **2 \u2013 Data Link Layer** | Node to Node Delivery of Message. | Frames | [Ethernet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ethernet/), PPP, etc. |\n| **3 \u2013 Network Layer** | Transmission of data from one host to another, located in different networks. | Packets | IP, [ICMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/), [IGMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-igmpinternet-group-management-protocol/), [OSPF](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-shortest-path-first-ospf-protocol-states/), etc. |\n| **4 \u2013 Transport Layer** | Take Service from Network Layer and provide it to the Application Layer. | Segments (for TCP) or Datagrams (for UDP) | [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/), [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/), [SCTP,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-control-transmission-protocol/) etc. |\n| **5 \u2013 Session Layer** | Establishes Connection, Maintenance, Ensures Authentication and Ensures security. | Data | [NetBIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-netbios-enumeration/), [RPC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/), [PPTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pptp-full-form/), etc. |\n| **6 \u2013 Presentation Layer** | Data from the application layer is extracted and manipulated in the required format for transmission. | Data | [TLS/SSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ssl-tls-handshake/), [MIME](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multipurpose-internet-mail-extension-mime-protocol/), JPEG, PNG, ASCII, etc. |\n| **7 \u2013 Application Layer** | Helps in identifying the client and synchronizing communication. | Data | [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-in-application-layer/), [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/), [DNS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/), [DHCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp/), etc. |\n\n## Why Does the OSI Model Matter?\n\nThe OSI Model matters because it provides the user a clear structure of \u201chow the data moves in the network?\u201d. As the OSI Model consists of 7 layers, each layer has its specific role, and due to which it helps in understanding, identifying and solving the complex network problems easily by focusing on one of the layers not the entire network.\n\nAs the modern Internet does not prefer the OSI Model, but still, the OSI Model is still very helpful for solving network problems. It helps people understanding network concepts very easily.\n\n## **Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP Model**\n\n| OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |\n| --- | --- |\n| OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. | TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. |\n| OSI model has 7 layers. | TCP/IP model consists of 4 layers. |\n| Package delivery is guaranteed in OSI Model. | Package delivery is not guaranteed in the TCP/IP Model. |\n| In the OSI model, only layers 1,2 and 3 are necessary for data transmission. | All layers of the TCP/IP model are needed for data transmission. |\n| Protocols at each layer is independent of the other layer. | Layers are integrated; some layers are required by other layers of TCP/IP model. |\n| OSI Model is a conceptual framework, less used in practical applications. | Widely used in actual networks like Internet and Communication Systems. |\n\n![OSI-vs-TCP/IP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240615134832/OSI-vs-TCP.png)\n\nOSI vs TCP/IP\n\n## Advantages of OSI Model\n\nThe OSI Model defines the communication of a computing system into 7 different layers. Its advantages include:\n\n- It divides network communication into 7 layers which makes it easier to understand and troubleshoot.\n- It standardizes network communications, as each layer has fixed functions and protocols.\n- Diagnosing network problems is easier with the **OSI model.**\n- It is easier to improve with advancements as each layer can get updates separately.\n\n## Disadvantages of OSI Model\n\n- The OSI Model has seven layers, which can be complicated and hard to understand for beginners.\n- In real-life networking, most systems use a simpler model called the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), so the OSI Model is not always directly applicable.\n- Each layer in the OSI Model adds its own set of rules and operations, which can make the process more time-consuming and less efficient.\n- The OSI Model is more of a theoretical framework, meaning it\u2019s great for understanding concepts but not always practical for implementation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model helps us understand how data moves in networks. It consists of seven distinct layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. Since it is a conceptual model, but the OSI framework is still widely used to troubleshoot and understand networking issues.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on OSI Model \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Can OSI layers work independently?**\n\n> No, OSI layers do not work independently. Each layer depends on the services provided by the layer below it and, in turn, provides services to the layer above it. This layered approach ensures that data is transmitted smoothly from the source to the destination.\n\n### **How does the OSI Model help in troubleshooting network issues?**\n\n> By breaking down communication into layers, the OSI Model helps network administrators isolate problems more easily.\n\n### **What happens if a layer in the OSI Model fails?**\n\n> If a particular OSI layer fails, data transmission may be disrupted or fail entirely. Network administrator will check layer by layer to identify and resolve the issue, make sure that each layer is functioning correctly or not.\n\n### **How does DNS fit into the OSI Model?**\n\n> The Domain Name System (DNS) operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer). It translates domain names into IP addresses, facilitating communication between users and services across the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Physical Layer in OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1.22k\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-science-quizzes-gq/gate-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which are the core protocols of the Internet. This model defines how data is transmitted over networks, ensuring reliable communication between devices. It consists of four layers: the Link Layer, the Internet Layer, the Transport Layer, and the Application Layer. Each layer has specific functions that help manage different aspects of network communication, making it essential for understanding and working with modern networks.\n\nTCP/IP was designed and developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s and is based on standard protocols. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike the seven layers in the OSI model. In this article, we are going to discuss the TCP/IP model in detail.\n\nTCP/IP model was developed alongside the creation of the ARPANET, which later became the foundation of the modern internet. It was designed with a focus on the practical aspects of networking at the time. The lower-level hardware details and physical transmission medium were largely abstracted away in favor of higher-level networking protocols.\n\n## What Does TCP/IP Do?\n\nThe main work of TCP/IP is to transfer the data of a computer from one device to another. The main condition of this process is to make data reliable and accurate so that the receiver will receive the same information which is sent by the sender. To ensure that, each message reaches its final destination accurately, the TCP/IP model divides its data into packets and combines them at the other end, which helps in maintaining the accuracy of the data while transferring from one end to another end. The TCP/IP model is used in the context of the real-world internet, where a wide range of physical media and network technologies are in use. Rather than specifying a particular Physical Layer, the TCP/IP model allows for flexibility in adapting to different physical implementations.\n\n## Difference Between TCP and IP\n\n| **Feature** | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** | **IP (Internet Protocol)** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Purpose** | Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. | Provides addressing and routing of packets across networks. |\n| **Type** | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |\n| **Function** | Manages data transmission between devices, ensuring data integrity and order. | Routes packets of data from the source to the destination based on IP addresses. |\n| **Error Handling** | Yes, includes error checking and recovery mechanisms. | No, IP itself does not handle errors; relies on upper-layer protocols like TCP. |\n| **Flow Control** | Yes, includes flow control mechanisms. | No |\n| **Congestion Control** | Yes, manages network congestion. | No |\n| **Data Segmentation** | Breaks data into smaller packets and reassembles them at the destination. | Breaks data into packets but does not handle reassembly. |\n| **Header Size** | Larger, 20-60 bytes | Smaller, typically 20 bytes |\n| **Reliability** | Provides reliable data transfer | Does not guarantee delivery, reliability, or order. |\n| **Transmission Acknowledgment** | Yes, acknowledges receipt of data packets. | No |\n\n## How Does the TCP/IP Model Work?\n\nWhenever we want to send something over the internet using the TCP/IP Model, the TCP/IP Model divides the data into packets at the sender\u2019s end and the same packets have to be recombined at the receiver\u2019s end to form the same data, and this thing happens to maintain the accuracy of the data. TCP/IP model divides the data into a 4-layer procedure, where the data first go into this layer in one order and again in reverse order to get organized in the same way at the receiver\u2019s end.\n\nFor more, you can refer to [TCP/IP in Computer Networking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking).\n\n## Layers of TCP/IP Model\n\n- Application Layer\n- Transport Layer(TCP/UDP)\n- Network/Internet Layer(IP)\n- Network Access Layer\n\nThe diagrammatic comparison of the **TCP/IP and OSI** model is as follows:\n\n![TCP/IP and OSI](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230417045622/OSI-vs-TCP-vs-Hybrid-2.webp)\n\nTCP/IP and OSI\n\n## **1\\. Network Access Layer**\n\nThe Network Access Layer represents a collection of applications that require network communication. This layer is responsible for generating data and initiating connection requests. It operates on behalf of the sender to manage data transmission, while the Network Access layer on the receiver\u2019s end processes and manages incoming data. In this article, we will focus on its role from the receiver\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe packet\u2019s network protocol type, in this case, TCP/IP, is identified by network access layer. Error prevention and \u201cframing\u201d are also provided by this layer. [Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/point-to-point-protocol-ppp-frame-format) framing and Ethernet IEEE 802.2 framing are two examples of data-link layer protocols.\n\n## 2\\. Internet or Network Layer\n\nThis layer parallels the functions of OSI\u2019s Network layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for the logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols residing at this layer are as follows:\n\n- **IP:** [IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address) stands for Internet Protocol and it is responsible for delivering packets from the source host to the destination host by looking at the IP addresses in the packet headers. IP has 2 versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the one that most websites are using currently. But IPv6 is growing as the number of IPv4 addresses is limited in number when compared to the number of users.\n- **ICMP:** [ICMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-icmp-and-igmp) stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is encapsulated within IP datagrams and is responsible for providing hosts with information about network problems.\n- **ARP:** [ARP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works) stands for Address Resolution Protocol. Its job is to find the hardware address of a host from a known IP address. ARP has several types: Reverse ARP, Proxy ARP, Gratuitous ARP, and Inverse ARP.\n\nThe Internet Layer is a layer in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, which is the set of protocols that define the Internet. The Internet Layer is responsible for routing packets of data from one device to another across a network. It does this by assigning each device a unique IP address, which is used to identify the device and determine the route that packets should take to reach it.\n\n**Example:** Imagine that you are using a computer to send an email to a friend. When you click \u201csend,\u201d the email is broken down into smaller packets of data, which are then sent to the Internet Layer for routing. The Internet Layer assigns an IP address to each packet and uses routing tables to determine the best route for the packet to take to reach its destination. The packet is then forwarded to the next hop on its route until it reaches its destination. When all of the packets have been delivered, your friend\u2019s computer can reassemble them into the original email message.\n\nIn this example, the Internet Layer plays a crucial role in delivering the email from your computer to your friend\u2019s computer. It uses IP addresses and routing tables to determine the best route for the packets to take, and it ensures that the packets are delivered to the correct destination. Without the Internet Layer, it would not be possible to send data across the Internet.\n\n## 3\\. Transport Layer\n\nThe TCP/IP transport layer protocols exchange data receipt acknowledgments and retransmit missing packets to ensure that packets arrive in order and without error. End-to-end communication is referred to as such. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol are transport layer protocols at this level (UDP).\n\n- **TCP:** Applications can interact with one another using [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp) as though they were physically connected by a circuit. TCP transmits data in a way that resembles character-by-character transmission rather than separate packets. A starting point that establishes the connection, the whole transmission in byte order, and an ending point that closes the connection make up this transmission.\n- **UDP:** The datagram delivery service is provided by [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp) , the other transport layer protocol. Connections between receiving and sending hosts are not verified by UDP. Applications that transport little amounts of data use UDP rather than TCP because it eliminates the processes of establishing and validating connections.\n\n## 4\\. Application Layer\n\nThe Application Layer in the TCP/IP model combines the functions of three layers from the **OSI model**: the **Application**, **Presentation**, and **Session** layers. This layer is analogous to the transport layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for end-to-end communication and error-free delivery of data. It shields the upper-layer applications from the complexities of data. The three main protocols present in this layer are:\n\n- **HTTP and HTTPS:** [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-http-and-https-2) stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. It is used by the World Wide Web to manage communications between web browsers and servers. HTTPS stands for HTTP-Secure. It is a combination of HTTP with SSL(Secure Socket Layer). It is efficient in cases where the browser needs to fill out forms, sign in, authenticate, and carry out bank transactions.\n- **SSH:** [SSH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-sshsecure-shell-keys) stands for Secure Shell. It is a terminal emulations software similar to Telnet. The reason SSH is preferred is because of its ability to maintain the encrypted connection. It sets up a secure session over a TCP/IP connection.\n- **NTP:** [NTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-time-protocol-ntp) stands for Network Time Protocol. It is used to synchronize the clocks on our computer to one standard time source. It is very useful in situations like bank transactions. Assume the following situation without the presence of NTP. Suppose you carry out a transaction, where your computer reads the time at 2:30 PM while the server records it at 2:28 PM. The server can crash very badly if it\u2019s out of sync.\n\nThe host-to-host layer is a layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that is responsible for providing communication between hosts (computers or other devices) on a network. It is also known as the transport layer.\n\nSome common use cases for the host-to-host layer include:\n\n- **Reliable Data Transfer:** The host-to-host layer ensures that data is transferred reliably between hosts by using techniques like error correction and flow control. For example, if a packet of data is lost during transmission, the host-to-host layer can request that the packet be retransmitted to ensure that all data is received correctly.\n- **Segmentation and Reassembly:** The host-to-host layer is responsible for breaking up large blocks of data into smaller segments that can be transmitted over the network, and then reassembling the data at the destination. This allows data to be transmitted more efficiently and helps to avoid overloading the network.\n- **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing:** The host-to-host layer is responsible for multiplexing data from multiple sources onto a single network connection, and then demultiplexing the data at the destination. This allows multiple devices to share the same network connection and helps to improve the utilization of the network.\n- **End-to-End Communication:** The host-to-host layer provides a connection-oriented service that allows hosts to communicate with each other end-to-end, without the need for intermediate devices to be involved in the communication.\n\n**Example:** Consider a network with two hosts, A and B. Host A wants to send a file to host B. The host-to-host layer in host A will break the file into smaller segments, add error correction and flow control information, and then transmit the segments over the network to host B. The host-to-host layer in host B will receive the segments, check for errors, and reassemble the file. Once the file has been transferred successfully, the host-to-host layer in host B will acknowledge receipt of the file to host A.\n\nIn this example, the host-to-host layer is responsible for providing a reliable connection between host A and host B, breaking the file into smaller segments, and reassembling the segments at the destination. It is also responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing the data and providing end-to-end communication between the two hosts.\n\n## Why TCP/IP Model Does Not Have Physical Layer\n\nThe physical layer is not covered by the TCP/IP model because the data link layer is considered the point at which the interface occurs between the TCP/IP stock and the underlying network hardware. Also, it is designed to be independent of the underlying physical media. This allows TCP/IP to be flexible and adaptable to different types of physical connections, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, fiber optics, or even older technologies like dial-up modems. The physical layer is typically handled by hardware components and standards specific to the physical medium being used, like Ethernet cables or radio waves for Wi-Fi.\n\n## Other Common Internet Protocols\n\nTCP/IP Model covers many Internet Protocols. The main rule of these Internet Protocols is how the data is validated and sent over the Internet. Some Common Internet Protocols include:\n\n- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form) takes care of Web Browsers and Websites.\n- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-in-application-layer) takes care of how the file is to be sent over the Internet.\n- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp) is used to send and receive data.\n\n## Difference between TCP/IP and OSI Model\n\n| **TCP/IP** | **OSI** |\n| --- | --- |\n| TCP refers to Transmission Control Protocol. | OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection. |\n| TCP/IP uses both the session and presentation layer in the application layer itself. | OSI uses different session and presentation layers. |\n| TCP/IP follows connectionless a horizontal approach. | OSI follows a vertical approach. |\n| The Transport layer in TCP/IP does not provide assurance delivery of packets. | In the OSI model, the transport layer provides assurance delivery of packets. |\n| Protocols cannot be replaced easily in TCP/IP model. | While in the OSI model, Protocols are better covered and are easy to replace with the technology change. |\n| TCP/IP model network layer only provides connectionless (IP) services. The transport layer (TCP) provides connections. | Connectionless and connection-oriented services are provided by the network layer in the OSI model. |\n\n## Advantages of TCP/IP Model\n\n- **Interoperability** : The TCP/IP model allows different types of computers and networks to communicate with each other, promoting compatibility and cooperation among diverse systems.\n- **Scalability** : TCP/IP is highly scalable, making it suitable for both small and large networks, from local area networks (LANs) to wide area networks (WANs) like the internet.\n- **Standardization** : It is based on open standards and protocols, ensuring that different devices and software can work together without compatibility issues.\n- **Flexibility** : The model supports various routing protocols, data types, and communication methods, making it adaptable to different networking needs.\n- **Reliability** : TCP/IP includes error-checking and retransmission features that ensure reliable data transfer, even over long distances and through various network conditions.\n\n## Disadvantages of TCP/IP Model\n\n- **Complex Configuration** : Setting up and managing a TCP/IP network can be complex, especially for large networks with many devices. This complexity can lead to configuration errors.\n- **Security Concerns** : TCP/IP was not originally designed with security in mind. While there are now many security protocols available (such as SSL/TLS), they have been added on top of the basic TCP/IP model, which can lead to vulnerabilities.\n- **Inefficiency for Small Networks** : For very small networks, the overhead and complexity of the TCP/IP model may be unnecessary and inefficient compared to simpler networking protocols.\n- **Limited by Address Space** : Although IPv6 addresses this issue, the older IPv4 system has a limited address space, which can lead to issues with address exhaustion in larger networks.\n- **Data Overhead** : TCP, the transport protocol, includes a significant amount of overhead to ensure reliable transmission. This can reduce efficiency, especially for small data packets or in networks where speed is crucial.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the TCP/IP model is the backbone of modern internet communication, allowing different devices and networks to connect and share information reliably. Despite some complexity and security concerns, its flexibility, scalability, and widespread adoption make it essential for both small and large networks. Overall, the TCP/IP model is crucial for ensuring efficient and effective network communication.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on TCP/IP Model \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Which IP Addresses Do TCP/IP Work With?\n\n> TCP/IP generally works with both the IP that is, [IPv4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4) and [IPv6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv6).

Understanding the fundamental structures of networking is crucial for anyone working with computer systems and communication. For data communication two models are available, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model, and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model.\n\nThese models work as frameworks for organizing and understanding how data moves from one device to another across networks. While both models aim to achieve similar goals, they differ in their approach, layer organization, and practical application within computer networking. We will discuss these two models in this article and also see the differences between the two models.\n\n## OSI Model\n\n[OSI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/) stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It has 7 layers [Physical layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/), [Data Link layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-link-layer/), [Network layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-in-osi-model/), [Transport layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-in-osi-model/), [Session layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model/), [Presentation layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/), and [Application layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/). Each layer performs its task independently. It was developed in 1984 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\n![OSI-Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240712153238/OSI-Model.png)\n\nOSI Model\n\n## Data Flow in OSI Model\n\nThe data flow in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model describes how data is transmitted from one device to another through the seven layers of the OSI model. This process involves encapsulation and decapsulation at each layer to ensure proper data transmission and reception.\n\nThe data flow in the OSI model involves encapsulating data at each layer on the sender side, transmitting it over the network, and decapsulating it at each layer on the receiver side to ensure the data reaches its intended destination correctly and reliably.\n\n![OSI Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210220204638/cn1.png)\n\nOSI Model\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n- Both connection-oriented services and connectionless services are supported.\n- It is quite flexible.\n- All the layers work independently.\n\n### **Disadvantages**\n\n- Setting up a model is a challenging task.\n- Sometimes, it becomes difficult to fit a new protocol into this model.\n- It is only used as a reference model.\n\n## TCP/IP Model\n\n[TCP/IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/) stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It has 4 layers named as Physical layer, Network layer, Transport layer, and Application layer. \u00a0It also can be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network. It was designed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in the 1970s.\n\n![TCP/IP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230411110343/tcp.jpg)\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n- Many Routing protocols are supported.\n- It is highly scalable and uses a client-server architecture.\n- It is lightweight.\n\n### **Disadvantages**\n\n- Little difficult to set up.\n- Delivery of packets is not guaranteed by the transport layer.\n- Vulnerable to a synchronization attack.\n\n## Similarities Between OSI Model and TCP/IP Model\n\nOSI and TCP/IP both are logical models. One of the main similarities between the OSI and TCP/IP models is that they both describe how information is transmitted between two devices across a network. Both models define a set of layers. Each layer performs a specific set of functions to enable the transmission of data.\n\nAnother similarity between the two models is that they both use the concept of [encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/), in which data is packaged into a series of headers and trailers that contain information about the data being transmitted and how it should be handled by the network.\n\nFor more information, you can refer [Similarities between TCP/IP model and the OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/similarities-between-tcp-ip-model-and-osi-model/) article.\n\n## Differences Between OSI Model and TCP/IP Model\n\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model and the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model are two frameworks used to understand how data moves through networks. While they both help in organizing network communication, they have distinct structures and purposes. Understanding these differences is essential for anyone learning about or working with computer networks.\n\n![OSI-vs-TCP/IP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240701125905/OSI-vs-TCP.png)\n\nOSI vs TCP/IP\n\n| Parameters | OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Full Form** | OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection | TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol |\n| **Layers** | It has 7 layers | It has 4 layers |\n| **Usage** | It is low in usage | It is mostly used |\n| **Approach** | It is vertically approached | It is horizontally approached |\n| **Delivery** | Delivery of the package is guaranteed in OSI Model | Delivery of the package is not guaranteed in TCP/IP Model |\n| **Replacement** | Replacement of tools and changes can easily be done in this model | Replacing the tools is not easy as it is in OSI Model |\n| **Reliability** | It is less reliable than TCP/IP Model | It is more reliable than OSI Model |\n| Protocol Example | Not tied to specific protocols, but examples include HTTP (Application), SSL/TLS (Presentation), TCP (Transport), IP (Network), Ethernet (Data Link) | HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP, IP, Ethernet |\n| Error Handling | Built into Data Link and Transport layers | Built into protocols like TCP |\n| Connection Orientation | Both connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) protocols are covered at the Transport layer | TCP (connection-oriented), UDP (connectionless) |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while both the OSI Model and TCP/IP Model are essential for understanding network communication, they differ in their structure and practical application. The OSI Model provides a theoretical framework with seven layers, emphasizing clear separation of functions, while the [TCP/IP Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/), with its four layers, reflects the protocols used on the internet today. Each model offers unique insights into how data is transmitted across networks, catering to different aspects of network design, management, and troubleshooting.\n\n## Difference Between OSI Model and TCP/IP Model \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Which layers of OSI are relevant to TCP?\n\n> TCP primarily operates in the Transport layer of the OSI model. However, its functioning also involves aspects related to the Network and Data Link layers, as it relies on lower-level protocols and technologies for data delivery.\n\n### Are OSI and TCP concepts outdated?\n\n> The OSI model remains relevant as a fundamental concept for understanding networking, but TCP/IP has become the de facto standard for internet communication. Newer technologies and protocols have emerged, but TCP/IP\u2019s widespread usage makes it a central consideration in modern networking.\n\n### Can TCP work without OSI?\n\n> TCP was designed based on the principles outlined in the OSI model, but it can operate independently of the OSI framework. However, the OSI model provides a conceptual foundation that aids in understanding how TCP and other networking protocols work together.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-full-form/?ref=next_article)\n\n[MAC Full Form - Media Access Control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-full-form/?ref=next_article)\n\n[H](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/harleenk_99/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[harleenk\\_99](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/harleenk_99/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n39\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Difference Between](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/difference-between/?ref=article_category)\n- [OSI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/osi/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It consists of various network components such as power plugs, connectors, receivers, cable types, etc. The physical layer sends data bits from one device(s) (like a computer) to another device(s).\n\n![31](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127181414133276/31.webp)\n\nPhysical Layer in OSI Model\n\nThe physical Layer defines the types of encoding (that is how the 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s are encoded in a signal). It is responsible for the communication of the unstructured raw data streams over a physical medium.\n\n## **Functions Performed by Physical Layer**\n\nThe **Physical Layer** is responsible for sending raw data as bits over a physical medium. It converts data into signals that can travel through wires, fiber optics, or wireless channels ( **encoding**) and turns these signals back into data at the receiver ( **decoding**). It ensures signals are transmitted correctly and uses techniques like **modulation** to prepare the data for transmission and **demodulation** to retrieve it at the other end. This layer also decides how data flows (one-way, two-way alternately, or simultaneously) through **transmission modes** and controls the speed and timing of data transmission to keep everything running smoothly.\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128104535679905/functions_of_physical_layer.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128104535679905/functions_of_physical_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154953861932/functions_of_physical_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154953861932/functions_of_physical_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954043475/functions_of_physical_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954043475/functions_of_physical_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954181351/functions_of_physical_layer_3.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954181351/functions_of_physical_layer_3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954332894/functions_of_physical_layer_4.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954332894/functions_of_physical_layer_4.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954490878/functions_of_physical_layer_5.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954490878/functions_of_physical_layer_5.webp)\n\n![functions_of_physical_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954638530/functions_of_physical_layer_6.webp)![functions_of_physical_layer_6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250124154954638530/functions_of_physical_layer_6.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 7\n\nTo read in detail about services offered by this layer, refer to [Physical Layer Services](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-services).\n\n## **Physical Topologies**\n\n**Physical topologies** describe the physical arrangement of devices and cables in a network.

Point to point link :** This is the kind of topology that relies upon two functions i.e. Transmit and Receive. It is a type of communication network between two communication nodes where there is one transmitter and on the other end, there is the receiver. It is a kind of communication medium which have two endpoints or end nodes. They provide high bandwidth\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- Efficiency: P2P networks are highly efficient as they allow for direct communication between two devices without any intermediate devices or network components.\n- Security: P2P networks are relatively more secure than other topologies as they do not rely on intermediate devices that can be compromised or attacked.\n- Simple Configuration: P2P networks are easy to configure and require minimal management or administration.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- Limited Scalability: P2P networks are not scalable as adding new devices requires establishing a separate link between each new device and the existing network, which can be time-consuming and expensive.\n- Maintenance: P2P networks can be difficult to maintain as each device has to be managed separately.\n- Lack of Redundancy: P2P networks do not provide redundancy, which can be a problem if a link fails or a device goes offline. with a dedicated communication connection between two systems.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201224191428/UntitledDiagram.png)\n\n**2\\.** [**Star topology**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-topology/) **:** It is that type of topology which contains a central node to which all of the other or different nodes are connected through a single path. In this topology, each and every host is connected to a central hub.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- Scalability: Star networks are highly scalable as new devices can be added easily by connecting them to the central hub or switch.\n- Easy Management: Star networks are easy to manage as all devices are connected to a central hub or switch, making it easy to troubleshoot and maintain.\n- Redundancy: Star networks provide redundancy as multiple paths exist between devices, reducing the risk of network failure.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- Cost: Star networks can be expensive as they require a central hub or switch, which can be costly.\n- Single Point of Failure: Star networks have a single point of failure, which is the central hub or switch. If the hub or switch fails, the entire network becomes non-functional.\n- Network Performance: The performance of a star network depends on the capacity of the central hub or switch. If the hub or switch is not able to handle the traffic, the network performance can be impacted.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201224192317/UntitledDiagram1.png)\n\n**Similarities between P2P Link and Star Topology Networks:**\n\n- Data Transmission: Both P2P Link and Star Topology Networks are used for transmitting data between network-enabled devices. They provide a communication medium that enables devices to communicate with each other.\n\nWired and Wireless Connections: Both P2P Link and Star Topology Networks can use either wired or wireless connections. Wired connections include Ethernet cables, while wireless connections include Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.\n- Network Devices: Both P2P Link and Star Topology Networks can include various network devices, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, or any other network-enabled devices.\n- Security: Both P2P Link and Star Topology Networks can implement security measures to protect the network and the data transmitted over it. For example, both network types can use encryption to secure data.\n- Fault Tolerance: Both P2P Link and Star Topology Networks can implement fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure network reliability. For example, redundant links can be used in P2P Link Networks to provide backup communication paths, while in Star Topology Networks, a backup hub or switch can be used to ensure network uptime.\n\n**Difference between Point to Point Link and Star Topology Network :**\n\n| Point to point link | Star topology |\n| --- | --- |\n| It grows in several ways. | It helps in providing easy access for service. |\n| This is the type of link which basically relies upon two functions only transmit and receive. | Only one device is there for per connection. |\n| Each station or nodes receives exactly from one transmitter. | It is very reliable. |\n| Each transmitter transmits to exactly one receiver. | It has a centralized control for the problem diagnosis. |\n| Both the transmit and receive operation can occur over separate wires. | It has simple access protocols. |\n| It is the type of high bandwidth network. | It has a very long cable length network. |\n| Very fast network topology as compared to the other network types. | All of the dependency is there on the central node. |\n| It is very simple and easy in connectivity. | It is a high performing as there are no collisions on data. |\n| Helps in providing low latency. | It is very easy to detect faults and remove parts. |\n| It is very easy to maintain and handle. | It is more expensive than other network topologies. |\n| Their nodes can be replaced within a seconds very easily. | It is very easy to install and wire. |\n\n**Conclusion :**\n\nboth Point-to-Point Link and Star Topology Networks have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific networking requirements.

The nodes are connected to each other completely via a dedicated link during which information travels from nodes to nodes. If a mesh network has N nodes, then there are N(N-1)/2 links. Each computer not only sends its signals but also transfer data from other computers. The connections within the mesh are often wired or wireless. In this article, we will discuss the Mesh Topology in detail.\n\n![Mesh-Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241021160145691259/Mesh-Topology.png)\n\nMesh Topology\n\n## Types of Mesh Topology\n\nThere are two types of Mesh topologies:\n\n- Fully-connected Mesh Topology\n- Partially-connected Mesh Topology\n\n![Full Mesh- Partial Mesh](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023175339695485/mesh-topology-2.webp)\n\nFull Mesh and Partial Mesh Topology\n\n### **Full Mesh Topology**\n\nAll the nodes within the network are connected with every other If there are n number of nodes during a network, each node will have an n-1 number of connections. A full mesh provides an excellent deal of redundancy, but because it is expensive to implement, it\u2019s usually reserved for network backbones. Total number of links required for the mesh topology is \\[n(n-1)\\]/2.\n\n### **Partial Mesh Topology**\n\nThe partial mesh is more practical as compared to the full mesh. In a partially connected mesh, all the nodes aren\u2019t necessary to be connected with one another during a network. Peripheral networks are connected using partial mesh topology.\n\n## Applications of Mesh Topology\n\nBelow mentioned are some of the applications of Mesh Topology:\n\n- **Wireless Networks:** Many homes and small office spaces uses Mesh Wifi System for better internet coverage and connectivity.\n- **Industrial and Manufacturing Networks:** Many industries uses mesh topology to control machinery, ensuring better productivity.\n- **Smart Homes:** Some advanced homes also use mesh topology for connecting home appliances like smart lights, security systems, etc.\n- Military Communication: Mesh Topology are used in Military Purposes as if one connection fails, then there is always a chance of another connection.\n\n## **Advantages of Mesh Topology**\n\n- In case of failure of a single device, the entire network didn\u2019t break.\n- There is no traffic problem as there is a dedicated point to point links for every device.\n- Mesh Topology provides high privacy and security.\n- Data transmission is more consistent because failure doesn\u2019t disrupt its processes.\n- Adding new devices won\u2019t disrupt transmission of data.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Mesh Topology**\n\n- Mesh Topology is costly as compared to the other network topologies i.e. star, bus, point to point topology.\n- Installation of nodes are difficult in mesh topology.\n- Power requirement is higher as all the nodes will need to remain active all the time and share the load.\n- Each node requires a extra utility cost.\n- More maintenance is required in mesh topology.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, mesh topology is a way to connect devices in a network where each device is linked directly to every other device. This setup is suitable for keeping the network reliable because if one connection breaks, the data can still find another way to reach its destination. As Mesh Topology is expensive and complicated to set up as compared to other network types like [star topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/), [bus topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/), etc. But its advantages make it worth considering, especially in situations where constant communication is essential, like in military systems, industrial settings, or smart homes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Mesh Topology \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### **Can mesh topology be implemented wirelessly?**\n\n> Yes, mesh topology can be implemented wirelessly, allowing devices to communicate without physical connections. This is common in wireless mesh networks that improve Wi-Fi coverage in homes and offices.\n\n### **What is the role of routers in a mesh topology?**\n\n> Routers in a mesh topology manage data traffic between devices, ensuring efficient routing and communication. They can also help maintain network connections and manage data flows effectively.\n\n### **How does mesh topology compare to other topologies?**\n\n> Compared to star topology, mesh offers greater reliability but at a higher cost and complexity. In contrast, bus topology is simpler and cheaper but less reliable, as a failure in the main cable can bring down the entire network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Star Topology?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[pulkitagarwal03pulkit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n21\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Mesh Topology?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMesh Topology is a network configuration where every device is interconnected with every other device, providing multiple route for data to travel.

The hub manages the data flow between the devices. If one device wants to send data to another device, it has to first send the information to the hub, and then the hub transmits that data to the required device.\n\nA star may be a Local Area Network (LAN) topology where all nodes are individually connected to a central connection point (hub). The number of links required to connect nodes in the star topology is N where N is the number of nodes. The [hub or switch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hub-and-switch/) manages and controls all functions of the network.\n\n![Star-Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241021160035921565/Star-Topology.png)\n\nStar Topology\n\n## How Does Star Topology Works in Computer Networks?\n\nAs we know, all the nodes in a star topology are connected to the Hub, and the **Hub** is responsible for the transmission of the data in the network. Whenever any node wants to transmit data to another node, it first transmits data to the central node (hub), and then it transfers the data to all the nodes on the network. After receiving the data, the hub checks for the destination address, and if the address matches the data is accepted otherwise data is rejected.\n\n## Types of Star Topology\n\nThere are two types of star topology:\n\n- Active Star Topology\n- Passive Star topology\n\n**Active Star Topology:** In active star topology, the central hub regenerates the signal when it passes through it. This simply means that the hub not only works as a connector but also boosts the signal and makes sure the signals reach their destination properly.\n\n**Passive Star Topology:** In passive star topology, the central hub simply connects the devices, but does not regenerate the signals. Here, the devices connected are responsible for the transmission of signals. Passive star topology is recommended for smaller setups.\n\n## What are the best practices of Star Topology?\n\nBelow mentioned are some of the applications of Star Topology:\n\n- **Home Networks:** Star Topology is used in a home network where all devices connects to a connected to a central router that manages the Internet.\n- **ATM Networks:** In banks, ATMs are also connected in as a star network, as it helps in managing data efficiently.\n- **Hospital Networks:** Hospital devices, medicinal equipment are connected in the star topology. It helps in easily accessing data records.\n- **CCTV Networks:** Star Topolgy are also used in CCTV Networks where multiple cameras are connected to central video recorder.\n\n## What is the Importance of Star Topology in LAN?\n\nStar Topology is important in Local Area Network because it helps in **easy management and scalability** of the network. As central hub is present in the star topology, it becomes simple to monitor and control network traffic among devices present int he network. Because of star topology, adding or removing devices becomes easy and it also helps in expanding networks.\n\n## **Advantages of Star Topology**\n\n- It is very reliable as if one cable or device fails then all the others will still work.\n- It is high performing as no data collisions can occur.\n- It is less expensive because each device only needs one I/O port and wishes to be connected to the hub with one link.\n- Easy fault detection because the links are often easily identified.\n- No disruptions to the network when connecting or removing devices.\n- Each device requires just one port i.e. to attach to the hub.\n- If N devices are connected to each other in star, then the amount of cables required to attach them is N. So, it\u2019s easy to line up.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Star Topology**\n\n- Requires more cable than [bus topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/).\n- If the connecting network device (network switch) fails, the nodes attached are disabled and can\u2019t participate in network communication.\n- More expensive than linear bus topology due to the value of the connecting devices (network switches).\n- If the hub goes down everything goes down, none of the devices can work without the hub.\n- Hub requires more resources and regular maintenance because it\u2019s the central system of Star.\n- Extra hardware is required (hubs or switches) which adds to the cost.\n- Performance is predicated on the one concentrator i.e. hub.\n\n## Difference Between Star and Bus Topology\n\n| Star Topology | Bus Topology |\n| --- | --- |\n| All devices are connected to a central hub | All devices are connected to a single central cable (called the bus) |\n| If a device fails, only that device is affected, the rest of the network keeps working | If a device fails, the rest of the network keeps working |\n| Requires more cable as compared to Bus Topology | Requires less cables as compared to Star Topology |\n| Motly used for small to medium size networks | Mostly used for simple networks having fewer devices |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, **star topology** is a simple and reliable way to set up a network. The star topology is used in [Local Area Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) where multiple connections are required for a network. Even if one device or cable fails, the rest of the network keeps working, but if the central hub goes down, the entire network stops. Star topology is widely used in homes, offices, etc. because it is easy to maintain and expand.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions On Star Topology \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Does star topology have good security?\n\n> Star Topology is secure because all data flows through a central switch, making monitoring easy. Each device connects separately, so issues can be isolated quickly.\n\n### Can star topology be wireless?\n\n> Yes, Star topology may be wireless because in star topology the nodes are connected with switcs or hub.\n\n### Where should firewalls be placed in a network topology?\n\n> Firewalls should be placed at the network\u2019s edge to block external threats, between segments to control internal access, and in front of critical servers to protect sensitive data. This layered setup enhances security.\n\n### **Can star topology be combined with other topologies?**\n\n> Yes, star topology can be combined with other topologies to form hybrid topologies. For example, in a star-bus topology, multiple star networks are connected via a central bus.\n\n### **What happens if the central hub in a star topology fails?**\n\n> If the central hub or switch fails, the entire network becomes inoperable since it is responsible for managing communication between all devices.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantage-and-disadvantage-of-mesh-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Mesh Topology?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantage-and-disadvantage-of-mesh-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[pulkitagarwal03pulkit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n32\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Star Topology?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nStar Topology is a network setup in which each device is connected to a central node called a hub.

A Bus Topology is one of them. All of the devices in a bus topology network are linked together by a single cable, which is referred to as a \u201cbus\u201d and the cable is known as backbone cable. All of the network\u2019s devices can simultaneously receive the same signal due to the shared communication medium provided by this connection. In this article, we are going to discuss what is bus topology and its various applications, advantages, and disadvantages.\n\n## What is Bus Topology?\n\n**Bus topology** carries transmitted data through the cable because data reaches each node, the node checks the destination address (MAC/IP address) to determine if it matches their address. If the address does not match with the node, the node does nothing more. But if the addresses of nodes match to addresses contained within the data then they process knowledge. In the bus, communication between nodes is done through a foremost network cable.\n\n![Bus Topology](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240221113117/3-55.png)\n\nBus Topology\n\n## Key Features of Bus Topology\n\n- An efficient bus architecture is established, and each station is connected by a single backbone cable.\n- There are two requirements: Initially, the nodes are connected to the backbone cable directly, or they use a drop cable to help them connect.\n- The well-known access method for bus topologies is called [CSMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma/) (Carrier Sense Multiple Access).\n\n## Best Practice for Designing Bus Topology\n\n1. **Plan for Scalability:** Plan for the network\u2019s future growth and expansion. Ensure that the bus topology can accommodate extra devices with out extensively affecting overall performance.\n2. **Use Good Quality Cabling:** Create a good cabling setup for the bus backbone. Ensure that the cable is properly shielded to minimize sign interference and degradation. Use cable with suitable bandwidth and make certain that it meets the necessities of the network.\n3. **Implement Redundancy:** Think about adding redundancy to decrease the risk of a single point of failure (SPoF).\n4. **Terminate the Bus Properly:** Terminate both ends of the bus with terminators to prevent signal reflection and ensure signal integrity. Improper termination can result in signal degradation and performance issues.\n\n## **Advantages of Bus Topology**\n\n- It is the easiest network topology for linearly connecting peripherals or computers.\n- It works very efficiently well when there is a small network.\n- The length of cable required is less than a star topology.\n- It is easy to connect or remove devices in this network without affecting any other device.\n- Very cost-effective as compared to other network topology i.e. mesh and star\n- It is easy to understand topology.\n- Easy to expand by joining the two cables together.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Bus Topology**\n\n- Bus topology is not good for large networks.\n- Identification of problems becomes difficult if the whole network goes down.\n- Troubleshooting individual device issues is very hard.\n- Need terminators are required at both ends of the main cable.\n- Additional devices slow the network down.\n- If the main cable is damaged, the whole network fails or splits into two.\n- Packet loss is high.\n- This network topology is very slow as compared to other [topologies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-topology/).\n\n## Applications of Bus Topology\n\n1. **Local Area Networks (** [**LANs**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/) **):** Bus topology was traditionally utilized in Ethernet [LANs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lan-full-form/), mainly in older implementations wherein [coaxial cables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-coaxial-cable/) have been daisy-chained to connect computer systems.\n2. **Industrial Control Systems:** In industrial control system, bus topology is frequently used for connecting sensors, actuators, and different devices in distributed manipulate systems.\n3. **Instrumentation Networks:** Bus topology is appropriate for connecting devices, meters, and records acquisition gadgets in laboratory or commercial environments.\n4. **Building Automation Systems:** Bus topology is employed in building automation and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) structures to attach sensors, thermostats, actuators, and other manage devices.\n5. **Telecommunications Networks**: Bus topology has traditionally been utilized in telephone networks and early records transmission systems. However, it has largely been changed by using more superior topologies like mesh or ring for telecommunications applications because of higher fault tolerance and scalability.\n\n## Data Transmission in Bus Topology\n\nIn a bus topology, data transmission takes place along a single backbone cable, known as the bus. The process of sending data in this particular network setup can be dissected in the following manner:\n\n1. **Structure:** A single backbone cable links all devices (nodes) and serves as a shared communication medium.\n2. **Data Transmission:** When a device needs to send data, it sends data bidirectionally along the bus. Data sent by any node is transmit to all other nodes in the network.\n3. **Data Reception:** While transmission in bus topology, each node analyzes the data destination address to determine if it is the designated receiver. If the node\u2019s address matches the destination address, the data is processed by the node, Otherwise, the data is ignored.\n4. **Collision Detection:** The bus being shared by all nodes increases the probabilty of data collisions when two devices transmit at the same time. In the majority of bus topologies, a technique such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection ( [CSMA/CD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collision-detection-csmacd/)) is implemented to handle collisions. [CSMA/CD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collision-detection-csmacd/) requires that devices supervise the bus to verify its availability before transmitting data and to recognize and handle collisions if they happen.\n\n## Types of Cables Used in Bus Topology\n\nCommon cable types used in bus topology include [coaxial cable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-coaxial-cable/) and [twisted-pair cable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twisted-pair-cable/).\n\n## Can Multiple Bus Topologies be Connected Together?\n\nYes, It is possible to connect multiple bus topologies together, but it\u2019s important to make sure the reliability and performance of the network. Following are the methods to connect multiple bus topologies:\n\n**1\\. Cascading Buses:** We can connect multiple bus topologies linearly, where the end of one bus becomes part of another, akin to chaining several buses together. Each part is connected at its ends, allowing devices on different parts to communicate.\n\n**2\\. Using Repeaters or Amplifiers:** To increase the length of a bus and connect multiple parts, repeaters or amplifiers can be utilized. These devices regenerate the signal to prevent damage over long distances, enabling the connection of multiple bus parts.\n\n**3\\. Segmenting with Network Hubs:** In certain scenarios, hubs or network devices can be utilized to join different bus parts. While this process introduces a form of central hub connectivity, it effectively integrates multiple bus topologies.\n\n**4\\. Hybrid Topologies:** Combining bus topologies with other topologies, such as star or tree topologies, can result in integrated network designs. For example, a star-bus topology integrates the characteristics of both bus and star topologies, where multiple bus segments are interlinked.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Bus Topology \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What are the components of bus topology?\n\n> The major components of bus topology include backbone cable , terminator and droplines.\n\n### Is there a server in bus topology?\n\n> In a bus architecture, every node is directly connected to a single main cable. The network\u2019s backbone is the primary cable. One of computer is work as a server from the network.\n\n### Is bus topology half-duplex or full- duplex?\n\n> Bus topology is half duplex.\n\n### **What happens if two devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously in a bus network?**\n\n> Data transfer in bus topology is accomplished by a procedure called \u201ccollision detection.\u201d A signal sent by one device on the network is broadcast to all other devices in the network. When two devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously, there is a collision that results in distorted signals.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-tree-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-tree-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[pulkitagarwal03pulkit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n34\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn computer network there are various topologies available.

In this each device is connected to with its exactly two neighboring devices, like points on a circle which forms like a ring structure. A number of repeaters are used for Ring topology with a large number of nodes to send data and to prevent data loss repeaters are used in this network. Together, devices during a ring topology are mentioned as a hoop network. In this packets travels from one device to another until they reach the desired destination. In this data travels in unidirectional forms means in only one direction but it can also do bidirectional by having 2 connections between each Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology. It is used in LANs and WANs depending on the card of network in the computer. ![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201022054334/432.png)**Advantages of Ring topology :**\n\n- In this data flows in one direction which reduces the chance of packet collisions.\n- In this topology additional workstations can be added after without impacting performance of the network.\n- Equal access to the resources.\n- There is no need of server to control the connectivity among the nodes in the topology.\n- It is cheap to install and expand.\n- Minimum collision.\n- Speed to transfer the data is very high in this type of topology.\n- Due to the presence of token passing the performance of ring topology becomes better than bus topology under heavy traffic.\n- Easy to manage.\n- Ring network is extremely orderly organized where every device has access to the token and therefore the opportunity to transmit.\n\n**Disadvantages of Ring topology :**\n\n- Due to the Uni-directional Ring, a data packet (token) must have to pass through all the nodes.\n- If one workstation shuts down, it affects whole network or if a node goes down entire network goes down.\n- It is slower in performance as compared to the bus topology\n- It is Expensive.\n- Addition and removal of any node during a network is difficult and may cause issue in network activity.\n- Difficult to troubleshoot the ring.\n- In order for all the computer to communicate with each other, all computer must be turned on.\n- Total dependence in on one cable.\n- They were not Scalable.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[pulkitagarwal03pulkit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of ring topology\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nRing Topology may be a network configuration where device connections create a circular data path.

Network topology can be used to make understand that it is the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks which includes command and control radio networks, industrial field busses, and other essential network. [**Tree Topology**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-network-topology/) **:** Tree Topology is a topology which is having a tree structure in which all the computers are connected like the branches which are connected with the tree. In Computer Network, tree topology is called a combination of a Bus and Star network topology. The main advantages of this topology are that is very flexible and also has better scalability. Tree network topology is considered to be the simplest topology in all the topologies which is having only one route between any two nodes on the network. The pattern of connection resembles a tree in which all branches spring from one root hence (Tree Topology).\n\nTree topology is one of the most popular among the five network topologies.\n\n**Advantages of Tree Topology :**\n\n- This topology is the combination of bus and star topology.\n- This topology provides a hierarchical as well as central data arrangement of the nodes.\n- As the leaf nodes can add one or more nodes in the hierarchical chain, this topology provides high scalability.\n- The other nodes in a network are not affected if one of their nodes gets damaged or does not work.\n- Tree topology provides easy maintenance and easy fault identification can be done.\n- A callable topology. Leaf nodes can hold more nodes.\n- Supported by several hardware and software vendors.\n- Point-to-point wiring for individual segments.\n- Tree Topology is highly secure.\n- It is used in WAN.\n- Tree Topology is reliable.\n\n**Disadvantages of Tree Topology :**\n\n- This network is very difficult to configure as compared to the other network topologies.\n- The length of a segment is limited & the limit of the segment depends on the type of cabling used.\n- Due to the presence of a large number of nodes, the network performance of tree topology becomes a bit slow.\n- If the computer on the first level is erroneous, the next-level computer will also go under problems.\n- Requires a large number of cables compared to star and ring topology.\n- As the data needs to travel from the central cable this creates dense network traffic.\n- The Backbone appears as the failure point of the entire segment of the network.\n- Treatment of the topology is pretty complex.\n- The establishment cost increases as well.\n- If the bulk of nodes is added to this network, then the maintenance will become complicated.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-bus-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[pulkitagarwal03pulkit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/pulkitagarwal03pulkit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n16\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Data Link Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-data-link-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetwork topology is the systematic arrangement of the elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network.

A hybrid topology can be a combination of bus topology, ring topology and mesh topology. The selection of different types of network topologies combined together depends upon the number of computers, their location, and the required performance. In the hybrid topology network sections consist of a configuration of different types of network topologies. The structure of hybrid topology is more complex but offers various advantages such as flexibility and fault tolerance.\n\n## Working of Hybrid Topology\n\n- Hybrid topology in computer networks is a combination of more than one topology.\n- This hybrid topology makes use of standards such as Wi-Fi and Ethernet for performing its different operations.\n- The functioning of hybrid topology depends upon various types of hybrid routers used such as switches and hubs as they can easily connect the devices that are connected over wired or wireless networks.\n- The hybrid topology has different network branches and each branch as its own unique design.\n- The functioning takes place by gaining various benefits of the both of the different topologies used.\n\n## Types of Hybrid Topologies\n\n### 1\\. Star-Ring Hybrid Topology\n\n![star-ring](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231021215124/star-ring.PNG)Star-Ring Hybrid Topology\n\nThe combination of star and ring topology forms a star-ring topology. Two or more than two star topologies are connected together through a ring topology using a wired connection. The flow of data in star-ring topology is bidirectional or unidirectional. If any node of the original ring topology gets fail the bidirectional data flow provides with the surety that there will be no effect on the rest of the data in network flow.\n\n### 2\\. Star-Bus Hybrid Topology\n\n![bus](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231021215514/bus.PNG)Star-Bus Hybrid Topology\n\nThe combination of star and bus topology is known as star-bus hybrid topology. Two or more star topologies are connected together with the help of bus topology through a wired connection. The bus topology can interrelate different star topologies and offers with a backbone structure. The entire network is not affected in case of any node failure. The failed node can be then easily replaced and offers with a easy way for adding or deleting the nodes. The overall network can be easily modified according to the need.\n\n### 3\\. Hierarchical Network Topology\n\nHierarchical network topology is designed like a hierarchical tree and also known as network tree topology. Hierarchical network topology is a combination of star-ring hybrid topology and star-bus hybrid topology. The maximum level of hierarchical network topology is known as root node or parent node. The sub-nodes of parent node are known as child nodes. The last nodes that does does not have any child are known as leaf nodes.\n\n## Advantages of Hybrid Topology\n\nBelow are the advantages of hybrid topology:\n\n- Adding a new node or deleting the existing node is easy in hybrid topologies.\n- Hybrid topology is more secure, reliable, and scalable as compared to individual star, ring and mesh topology.\n- Error detection and troubleshooting is easier in hybrid topology.\n- When an organization has a large geographical area utilizing hybrid topology is considered as better option.\n- Traffic with large volume is handled easily by the hybrid topology.\n- The overall performance and speed is greater in hybrid topology.\n\n## Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology\n\nBelow are the disadvantages of hybrid topology:\n\n- The design and implementation of hybrid network topology is difficult.\n- More number of cables and other physical devices are required for hybrid topology.\n- The process of installation of hybrid topology is difficult.\n- The overall implementation, setup and process of hybrid topology is much more costlier.\n\n\n## FAQs on Hybrid Topology\n\n### Q.1: Name the applications where hybrid topology is used?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Hybrid topology is used in various business such as finance sector, educational organisations and research centers.\n\n### Q.2: Can hybrid topology used for all the types of networks?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> No, hybrid topology is mainly used for complex networks that have varying requirements and applications where fault tolerance is important.\n\n### Q.3: Does hybrid topology consists of both wired and wireless connections?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Yes, hybrid topology is a combination of both wired and wireless connections. Both are used together according to the requirements of the user.\n\n### Q.4: What is the difference between fully meshed topology and a hybrid topology?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> The difference between fully meshed topology and a hybrid topology is that a fully meshed topology connect each device with the other available device in the network whereas a hybrid topology consists of a combination of two or more different topologies and every device in the network is connected to other devices.\n\n### Q.5: Does hybrid topology provide Quality of Service (QoS)?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Hybrid topology provides with Quality of Service (QoS) by properly configuring all the routers and other networking devices in the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Star Topology?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-star-topology/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibor7sjj/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[anjalibor7sjj](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anjalibor7sjj/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2023/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is Hybrid Topology?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA hybrid topology is defined as a network topology that combines two or more different network topologies.

They are classified into three types: Simplex Mode, Half-Duplex Mode, and Full-Duplex Mode. In this article, we will discuss Transmission Modes.\n\n## What is Transmission Modes?\n\nTransmission mode means transferring data between two devices. It is also known as a communication mode. [Buses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-bus-design/) and networks are designed to allow communication to occur between individual devices that are interconnected.\u00a0**There are three types of transmission modes:**\n\n![Transmission Mode](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/transmissionmodes.png)\n\n## **Simplex Mode**\n\nIn Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.\n\nExample: [Keyboard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-keyboard/) and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.\n\n![Simplex Mode](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/SiMpleduplex.png)\n\n### **Advantages of Simplex Mode**\n\n- Simplex mode is the easiest and most reliable mode of communication.\n- It is the most cost-effective mode, as it only requires one communication channel.\n- There is no need for coordination between the transmitting and receiving devices, which simplifies the communication process.\n- Simplex mode is particularly useful in situations where feedback or response is not required, such as [broadcasting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-broadcasting-in-computer-network/) or surveillance.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Simplex Mode**\n\n- Only one-way communication is possible.\n- There is no way to verify if the transmitted data has been received correctly.\n- Simplex mode is not suitable for applications that require bidirectional communication.\n\n## **Half-Duplex Mode**\n\nIn [half-duplex mode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-half-duplex-transmission-modes-and-full-duplex-transmission-modes/), each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa. The half-duplex mode is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. The entire capacity of the channel can be utilized for each direction.\n\nExample: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and messages are sent in both directions.\n\n```\nChannel capacity=Bandwidth * Propagation Delay\n```\n\n![Half Duplex Mode](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/halfduplex.png)\n\n### **Advantages of Half Duplex Mode**\n\n- Half-duplex mode allows for bidirectional communication, which is useful in situations where devices need to send and receive data.\n- It is a more efficient mode of communication than simplex mode, as the channel can be used for both transmission and reception.\n- Half-duplex mode is less expensive than full-duplex mode, as it only requires one communication channel.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Half Duplex Mode**\n\n- Half-duplex mode is less reliable than Full-Duplex mode, as both devices cannot transmit at the same time.\n- There is a delay between transmission and reception, which can cause problems in some applications.\n- There is a need for coordination between the transmitting and receiving devices, which can complicate the communication process.\n\n## **Full-Duplex Mode**\n\nIn full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. In full\\_duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways:\n\n- Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.\n- Or the capacity is divided between signals traveling in both directions.\n\nFull-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions.\n\nExample: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time.\n\n```\nChannel Capacity=2* Bandwidth*propagation Delay\n```\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fullduplex.png)\n\n### **Advantages of Full-Duplex Mode**\n\n- Full-duplex mode allows for simultaneous bidirectional communication, which is ideal for real-time applications such as video conferencing or online gaming.\n- It is the most efficient mode of communication, as both devices can transmit and receive data simultaneously.\n- Full-duplex mode provides a high level of reliability and accuracy, as there is no need for error correction mechanisms.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Full-Duplex Mode**\n\n- Full-duplex mode is the most expensive mode, as it requires two communication channels.\n- It is more complex than simplex and half-duplex modes, as it requires two physically separate transmission paths or a division of channel capacity.\n- Full-duplex mode may not be suitable for all applications, as it requires a high level of [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) and may not be necessary for some types of communication.\n\n## Difference Between Simplex, Half duplex, and Full Duplex Transmission Modes\n\n| Parameters | Simplex | Half Duplex | Full Duplex |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **The direction of communication** | Simplex mode\u00a0is a uni-directional communication. | Half Duplex\u00a0mode is a two-way directional communication but one at a time. | Full Duplex mode\u00a0is a two-way directional communication simultaneously. |\n| **Sender and Receiver** | In simplex mode, Sender can send the data but that sender can\u2019t receive the data. | In Half Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data but one at a time. | In Full Duplex mode, Sender can send the data and also can receive the data simultaneously. |\n| **Channel usage** | Usage of one channel for the transmission of data. | Usage of one channel for the transmission of data. | Usage of two channels for the transmission of data. |\n| **Performance** | The simplex mode provides less performance than half duplex and full duplex. | The Half Duplex mode provides less performance than full duplex. | Full Duplex provides better performance than simplex and half duplex mode. |\n| **Bandwidth Utilization** | Simplex utilizes the maximum of a single bandwidth. | The Half-Duplex involves lesser utilization of single bandwidth at the time of transmission. | The Full-Duplex doubles the utilization of transmission bandwidth. |\n| **Suitable for** | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of full bandwidth for delivering data. | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending data in both directions, but not at the same time. | It is suitable for those transmissions when there is requirement of sending and receiving data simultaneously in both directions. |\n| **Examples** | Example of simplex mode are: Keyboard and monitor. | Example of half duplex mode is: Walkie-Talkies. | Example of full duplex mode is: Telephone. |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTransmission modes enable communication between devices and are classified into three types: simplex mode, which allows unidirectional communication and is cost-effective but supports only one-way data transfer; half-duplex mode, which allows bidirectional communication but not simultaneously, offering a balance between efficiency and cost; and full-duplex mode, which enables simultaneous two-way communication, providing the highest efficiency and\u00a0reliability but is the most complex and expensive.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Transmission Media \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Among Simplex, Half duplex and Full Duplex Transmission Modes, which offers highest data rate?\n\n> Full Duplex Transmission Mode generally offers the highest data rate, because it can transmit in both directions simultaneously.\n\n### Which mode is most complex to implement?\n\n> Full Duplex transmission Mode is the most complex to implement because of its simultaneous transmission and receiving capabilities.\n\n### Is WiFi full duplex?\n\n> No [Wi-Fi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-wi-fiwireless-fidelity/) can not work as a full duplex.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-layer-discovery-protocol-lldp/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/link-layer-discovery-protocol-lldp/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n244\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CCNA Tutorial for Beginners\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis CCNA Tutorial is well-suited for the beginner as well as professionals, and It will cover all the basic to advanced concepts of CCNA like Components of Computer Networking, Transport Layer, Network Layer, CCNA training, Cisco Networking, Network Design, Routing and Switching, etc. which are req\\\\\n\\\\\n8 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ccna-tutorial-for-beginners/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Basics of Computer Networking\n\n- [Network and Communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNetworks and communication involve connecting different systems and devices to share data and information.

These medium can be\u00a0wired\u00a0or\u00a0wireless. The choice of medium depends on factors like distance, speed, and interference. In this article, we will discuss the transmission media. In this article we will see types of transmission media in detail.\n\n## What is Transmission Media in Computer Networks?\n\nA transmission medium is a physical path between the transmitter and the receiver i.e. it is the channel through which data is sent from one device to another. Transmission Media is broadly classified into the following types:\n\n![Types-of-Transmission-Media](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240731120431/Types-of-Transmission-Media.png)\n\nTypes of Transmission Media\n\n## **1\\. Guided Media**\n\n[Guided Media](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wired-communication-media/) is also referred to as Wired or Bounded transmission media. Signals being transmitted are directed and confined in a narrow pathway by using physical links.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- High Speed\n- Secure\n- Used for comparatively shorter distances\n\nThere are 3 major types of Guided Media:\n\n### **Twisted Pair Cable**\n\nIt consists of 2 separately insulated conductor wires wound about each other. Generally, several such pairs are bundled together in a protective sheath. They are the most widely used Transmission Media. [Twisted Pair](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twisted-pair-cable/) is of two types:\n\n- **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** [UTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-utpunshielded-twisted-pair/) consists of two insulated copper wires twisted around one another. This type of cable has the ability to block interference and does not depend on a physical shield for this purpose. It is used for telephonic applications.\n\n![Unshielded Twisted Pair](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240622103602/UntitledDiagram321-200x140.jpg)\n\nUnshielded Twisted Pair\n\n**Advantages of Unshielded Twisted Pair**\n\n- Least expensive\n- Easy to install\n- High-speed capacity\n\n**Disadvantages of Unshielded Twisted Pair**\n\n- Lower capacity and performance in comparison to STP\n- Short distance transmission due to attenuation\n\n![Shielded Twisted Pair](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240622104342/UntitledDiagram331-300x138.jpg)\n\nShielded Twisted Pair\n\n**Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):** [Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-stpshielded-twisted-pair/) cable consists of a special jacket (a copper braid covering or a foil shield) to block external interference. It is used in fast-data-rate Ethernet and in voice and data channels of telephone lines.\n\n**Advantages of Shielded Twisted Pair**\n\n- Better performance at a higher data rate in comparison to UTP\n- Eliminates crosstalk\n- Comparatively faster\n\n**Disadvantages of Shielded Twisted Pair**\n\n- Comparatively difficult to install and manufacture\n- More expensive\n- Bulky\n\n### **Coaxial Cable**\n\nCoaxial cable has an outer plastic covering containing an insulation layer made of PVC or Teflon and 2 parallel conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover. The [coaxial cable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-coaxial-cable/) transmits information in two modes: Baseband mode(dedicated cable bandwidth) and Broadband mode(cable bandwidth is split into separate ranges). Cable TVs and analog television networks widely use Coaxial cables.\n\n![ Coaxial Cable ](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240327120710/CoaxialCable-660x330.jpg)\n\n**Advantages of Coaxial Cable**\n\n- Coaxial cables has high [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) .\n- It is easy to install.\n- Coaxial cables are more reliable and durable.\n- Less affected by noise or cross-talk or electromagnetic inference.\n- Coaxial cables support multiple channels\n\n**Disadvantages of Coaxial Cable**\n\n- Coaxial cables are expensive.\n- The coaxial cable must be grounded in order to prevent any crosstalk.\n- As a Coaxial cable has multiple layers it is very bulky.\n- There is a chance of breaking the coaxial cable and attaching a \u201ct-joint\u201d by hackers, this compromises the security of the data.\n\n### **Optical Fiber Cable**\n\n[Optical Fibre Cable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optical-fibre-cable/) uses the concept total internal reflection of light through a core made up of glass. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the coating. It is used for the transmission of large volumes of data.\u00a0The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The [WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexer)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-wdm-and-dwdm/) supports two modes, namely unidirectional and bidirectional mode.\n\n![Optical Fibre Cable](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210716190121/UntitledDiagram62-300x196.png)\n\n### **Advantages of Optical Fibre Cable**\n\n- Increased capacity and bandwidth\n- Lightweight\n- Less signal attenuation\n- Immunity to electromagnetic interference\n- Resistance to corrosive materials\n\n### **Disadvantages of Optical Fibre Cable**\n\n- Difficult to install and maintain\n- High cost\n\n### **Applications of Optical Fibre Cable**\n\n- **Medical Purpose:** Used in several types of medical instruments.\n- **Defence Purpose:** Used in transmission of data in aerospace.\n- **For Communication:** This is largely used in formation of internet cables.\n- **Industrial Purpose:** Used for lighting purposes and safety measures in designing the interior and exterior of automobiles.\n\n### **Stripline**\n\n[Stripline](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/symmetric-stripline/) is a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) transmission line medium invented by Robert M. Barrett of the Air Force Cambridge Research Centre in the 1950s. Stripline is the earliest form of the planar transmission line. It uses a conducting material to transmit high-frequency waves it is also called a waveguide. This conducting material is sandwiched between two layers of the ground plane which are usually shorted to provide EMI immunity.\n\n### **Microstripline**\n\nA **microstripline** is a type of transmission media used to carry high-frequency signals, commonly found in microwave and radio frequency circuits. It consists of a flat, narrow conducting strip (usually made of metal) placed on top of a dielectric material (an insulating layer), with a metal ground plane on the other side.\n\n## **2\\. Unguided Media**\n\nIt is also referred to as Wireless or [Unbounded transmission media](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unguided-media/) . No physical medium is required for the transmission of electromagnetic signals.\n\n### **Features of Unguided Media**\n\n- The signal is broadcasted through air\n- Less Secure\n- Used for larger distances\n\nThere are 3 types of Signals transmitted through unguided media:\n\n### **Radio Waves**\n\n[Radio waves](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radio-waves/) are easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings. The sending and receiving antennas need not be aligned. Frequency Range:3KHz \u2013 1GHz. AM and FM radios and cordless phones use Radio waves for transmission.\n\n**Types of Radio Waves:**\n\n- **Short Wave:** AM Radio\n- **VHF (Very High Frequency):** FM Radio/TV\n- **UHF (Ultra High Frequency):** TV\n\n**Radio Wave Components:**\n\n- **Transmitter:** Responsible for encoding the signal.\n- **Receiver:** Responsible for decoding the signal.\n\n![radiowave](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023103614878853/radiowave.png)\n\nRadiowave\n\n### **Microwaves**\n\nIt is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the height of the antenna. Frequency Range:1GHz \u2013 300GHz. [**Micro waves**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-microwaves/) are majorly used for mobile phone communication and television distribution.\n\n**Advanges**:\n\n- Cheaper than using cables\n- Freedom from land acquisition\n- Ease of communication in difficult terrains\n- Communication over oceans\n\n**Disadvanges:**\n\n- Insecure communication.\n- Out-of-phase signal.\n- Susceptible to weather conditions.\n- Bandwidth is limited.\n- High cost of design, implementation, and maintenance.\n\n![Microwave-tranmission-media](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241016163102671994/Microwave-tranmission-media.png)\n\n### **Infrared**\n\n[Infrared waves](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/infrared-light-for-transmission/) are used for very short distance communication. They cannot penetrate through obstacles. This prevents interference between systems. Frequency Range:300GHz \u2013 400THz. It is used in TV remotes, wireless mouse, keyboard, printer, etc.\n\n![Infrared](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210716190816/infrared1-227x300.png)\n\n## Difference Between Radio Waves, Micro Waves, and Infrared Waves\n\n| Basis | Radiowave | Microwave | Infrared wave |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Direction | These are omni-directional in nature. | These are unidirectional in nature. | These are unidirectional in nature. |\n| Penetration | At low frequency, they can penetrate through solid objects and walls but high frequency they bounce off the obstacle. | At low frequency, they can penetrate through solid objects and walls. at high frequency, they cannot penetrate. | They cannot penetrate through any solid object and walls. |\n| Frequency range | Frequency range: 3 KHz to 1GHz. | Frequency range: 1 GHz to 300 GHz. | Frequency range: 300 GHz to 400 GHz. |\n| Security | These offers poor security. | These offers medium security. | These offers high security. |\n| Attenuation | Attenuation is high. | Attenuation is variable. | Attenuation is low. |\n| Government License | Some frequencies in the radio-waves require government license to use these. | Some frequencies in the microwaves require government license to use these. | There is no need of government license to use these waves. |\n| Usage Cost | Setup and usage Cost is moderate. | Setup and usage Cost is high. | Usage Cost is very less. |\n| Communication | These are used in long distance communication. | These are used in long distance communication. | These are not used in long distance communication. |\n\n## Causes of Transmission Impairment\n\nTransmission impairment refers to the loss or distortion of signals during data transmission, leading to errors or reduced quality in communication. Common causes include signal distortion, attenuation, and noise all of which can affect the clarity and reliability of transmitted data.\n\n![Transmission Impairment](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240622105652/data-communicaton-2.jpg)\n\nTransmission Impairment\n\n- **Attenuation:** It means loss of energy. The strength of signal decreases with increasing distance which causes loss of energy in overcoming resistance of medium. This is also known as attenuated signal. [Amplifiers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/power-amplifier/) are used to amplify the attenuated signal which gives the original signal back and compensate for this loss.\n- **Distortion:** It means changes in the form or shape of the signal. This is generally seen in composite signals made up with different frequencies. Each frequency component has its own propagation speed travelling through a medium. And thats why it delay in arriving at the final destination Every component arrive at different time which leads to distortion. Therefore, they have different phases at receiver end from what they had at senders end.\n- **Noise:** The random or unwanted signal that mixes up with the original signal is called noise. There are several types of noise such as induced noise, crosstalk noise, thermal noise and impulse noise which may corrupt the signal.\n\n## Factors Considered for Designing the Transmission Media\n\n- **Bandwidth:** Assuming all other conditions remain constant, the greater a medium\u2019s bandwidth, the faster a signal\u2019s data transmission rate.\n- **Transmission Impairment** : [Transmission Impairment](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transmission-impairment-in-data-communication/) occurs when the received signal differs from the transmitted signal. Signal quality will be impacted as a result of transmission impairment.\n- **Interference:** Interference is defined as the process of disturbing a signal as it travels over a communication medium with the addition of an undesired signal.\n\n## **Applications of Transmission Media in Computer Networks**\n\nTransmission media in computer networks are used to connect devices and transfer data. Here are some common applications:\n\n| **Transmission Media** | **Application** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** | Local Area Networks (LAN), telephones |\n| **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)** | Industrial networks, environments with high interference |\n| **Optical Fiber Cable** | Long-distance communication, internet backbones |\n| **Coaxial Cable** | Cable TV, broadband internet, CCTV |\n| **Stripline** | Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), microwave circuits |\n| **Microstripline** | Antennas, satellite communication, RF circuits |\n| **Radio** | Wireless communication, AM/FM radio, mobile phones |\n| **Infrared** | Remote controls, short-range communication |\n| **Microwave** | Satellite communication, radar, long-distance links |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, transmission media are fundamental ways for data transmission in networks, and they are classified as directed (wired) or unguided (wireless). Guided media, such as twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and optical fibers, provide secure, fast, and dependable data transmission over short distances. Unguided media, such as radio waves, microwaves, and infrared, provide wireless communication at various\u00a0distances, with security and [attenuation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/attenuation/) trade-offs. The choice of transmission media is determined by\u00a0bandwidth, transmission impairment, and interference.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Transmission Media \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What are three options for signal transmission on a network?\n\n> There are three common ways to send signals over a network:\n>\n> 1.
