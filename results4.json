This layer is responsible for setting up, coordinating, and terminating conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end. It establishes, manages, and terminates the connections between the local and remote applications.\n\n- The Session Layer is responsible for establishing active communication sessions between two devices.\n\n- In the OSI model, the transport layer is not responsible for releasing a connection. Instead, the session layer is responsible for that. However, in modern TCP/IP networks, TCP already provides orderly closing of connections at the transport layer.\n\n- Dialogue Control is also implemented in the Session Layer of the OSI model but in TCP/IP the dialogue control is implemented in the Application Layer.\n\n- Session-layer services are commonly used in application environments that use remote procedure calls ( [RPCs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)).\n\n- Zone Information Protocol in\u00a0[AppleTalk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-atp-appletalk-transaction-protocol/)\u00a0is an example of Session Layer Implementation.\n\n- Session Layer has synchronization and resynchronization techniques that ensure reliable and orderly communication over networks, which is particularly important in applications requiring high levels of data integrity and continuity.\n\n- Synchronization points are markers or tokens inserted into the data stream that allow communication sessions to have checkpoints and on the other hand Resynchronization involves restoring a session to a known state after a disruption, such as a network failure or session timeout.\n\n![27](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127104159934898/27.webp)\n\nSession Layer in OSI Model\n\nIn Session Layer, data streams are received and further marked, which is then resynchronized properly, so that the ends of the messages are not cut initially and further data loss is avoided. This layer establishes a connection between the session entities. This layer handles and manipulates data that it receives from the Session Layer as well as from the Presentation Layer.\n\n## **Functions of Session Layer**\n\nThe session layer performs several different as well as important functions that are needed for establishing as well as maintaining a safe and secure connection:\n\n1. **Session Establishment** : It establishes and manages sessions between communicating parties that cab be connection-oriented or connectionless. It also maps sessions to transport connections.\n2. **Communication Synchronization**: It ensures reliable connectivity and recovery by using **synchronization bits** and **checkpoints** in data stream.\n3. **Activity Management** : It allow the user to divide data into logical units called **activities**. An activity can be processed on its own and each activity is independent of activities that come before and after it.\n4. **Dialog Management** : It refers to deciding whose turn it is to talk.\u00a0Some applications uses a **token mechanism** for half-duplex mode, where only one party holds the token to transmit data while other supports full-duplex mode for simultaneous data transmission.\n5. **Data Transfer :** It manages data exchange between systems.\n6. **Resynchronization :** In this,\u00a0all the tokens are restored to the positions that were set during synchronization. The various options for resynchronization includes set, abandon and restart.\n\n![functions_of_session_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749580948/functions_of_session_layer.webp)![functions_of_session_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749580948/functions_of_session_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749809396/functions_of_session_layer1.webp)![functions_of_session_layer1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749809396/functions_of_session_layer1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750069183/functions_of_session_layer2.webp)![functions_of_session_layer2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750069183/functions_of_session_layer2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750299349/functions_of_session_layer3.webp)![functions_of_session_layer3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750299349/functions_of_session_layer3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750482160/functions_of_session_layer4.webp)![functions_of_session_layer4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750482160/functions_of_session_layer4.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750678631/functions_of_session_layer5.webp)![functions_of_session_layer5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750678631/functions_of_session_layer5.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750904704/functions_of_session_layer6.webp)![functions_of_session_layer6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750904704/functions_of_session_layer6.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 7\n\nRead in detail about [Functions of Session Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-session-layer/).\n\n## **Working of Session Layer**\n\n- The Session Layer manages communication sessions between applications over a network.\n- It establishes connections, negotiating session parameters like authentication and communication direction (full-duplex or half-duplex).\n- It oversees data exchange by using tokens to manage transmission rights and prevent collisions.\n- Synchronization techniques are implemented, inserting checkpoints for recovery in case of disruptions.\n- It ensures orderly communication, reducing message loss, duplication, or errors caused by overlapping communication.\n- The Session Layer gracefully terminates the session, ensuring all data is exchanged and both sides agree to close\n\n## **Session Layer Protocols**\n\nSession Layer uses some protocols which are required for safe, secure and accurate communication which exists between two-ender user applications. Following are some of the protocols provided or used by the Session Layer:\n\n- **AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (** [**ADSP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adsp-fullform/) **):** ADSP is that type of protocol which was developed by Apple Inc. and it includes a number of features that allow local area networks to be connected with no prior setup. This protocol was released in 1985.\u00a0This protocol rigorously followed the OSI model of protocol layering. ADSP itself has two protocols named: AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) and Name Binding Protocol ( [NBP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nbp-fullform/)), both aimed at making system self-configuring.\n\n- **Real-time Transport Control Protocol (** [**RTCP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-transport-control-protocol-rtcp/) **):** RTCP is a protocol which provides out-of-band statistics and control information for an RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) session. RTCP\u2019s primary function is to provide feedback on the quality of service (QoS) in media distribution by periodically sending statistical information such as transmitted octet and packet counts or packet loss to the participants in the streaming multimedia session.\n\n- **Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (** [**PPTP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pptp-full-form/) **):** PPTP is a protocol which provides a method for implementing virtual private networks. PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) packets This protocol provides security levels and remote access levels comparable with typical VPN ( [Virtual Private Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-virtual-private-network-vpn/)) products.\n\n- **Password Authentication Protocol (** [**PAP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-authentication-protocol-pap/) **):** It is a password-based authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to validate users. Almost all network operating systems, remote servers support PAP. PAP authentication is done at the time of the initial link establishment and verifies the identity of the client using a two-way handshake (Client-sends data and server in return sends Authentication-ACK (Acknowledgement) after the data sent by client is verified completely).\n\n- **Remote Procedure Call Protocol (** [**RPCP**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) **):** It is a protocol that is used when a computer program causes a procedure (or a sub-routine) to execute in a different address space without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. This is basically the form of client-server interaction, typically implemented via a request-response message-passing system.\n\n- **Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP):** It is a protocol that supports streams of sockets over Remote Direct Memory Access ( [RDMA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-direct-memory-access-rdma/)) network fabrics. The purpose of SDP is to provide an RDMA-accelerated alternative to the TCP protocol. The primary goal is to perform one particular thing in such a manner which is transparent to the application.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Session Layer in OSI Model \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n**What devices are in the session layer?**\n\n> Devices associated with the **Session Layer** include:\n>\n> - **Firewalls**: Manage session control by monitoring and filtering network connections.\n> - **Proxy Servers**: Establish and manage sessions between clients and servers.\n> - **Session Border Controllers (SBCs)**: Used in VoIP to manage and secure communication sessions.\n> - **Application Servers**: Handle session creation and management for applications.\n\n**How does the Session Layer differ from the Transport Layer?**\n\n> The Session Layer manages sessions (logical connections), while the Transport Layer ensures reliable data delivery.\n\n**How does the Session Layer handle synchronization?**\n\n> It uses checkpoints to allow data recovery in case of communication failure.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Presentation Layer in OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/u5jzqgea1vql16pxwkwg)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/amansingla/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[amansingla](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/amansingla/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n26\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

The session layer is responsible for maintaining, establishing, synchronizing, and terminating sessions between them. A connection is being established among the session entities by the session layer. The data received from the presentation layer is handled by the session layer. Various protocols such as [PPTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pptp-full-form/), [PAP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/password-authentication-protocol-pap/), [RTCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-transport-control-protocol-rtcp/), [ADSP,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adsp-fullform/) and SDP are used by the session layer. The below article covers the functions of the [session layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model/) in detail.\n\n## Functions of Session Layer\n\nThe session layer is responsible for various tasks that are mentioned below:\n\n![functions_of_session_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749580948/functions_of_session_layer.webp)![functions_of_session_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749580948/functions_of_session_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749809396/functions_of_session_layer1.webp)![functions_of_session_layer1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175749809396/functions_of_session_layer1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750069183/functions_of_session_layer2.webp)![functions_of_session_layer2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750069183/functions_of_session_layer2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750299349/functions_of_session_layer3.webp)![functions_of_session_layer3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750299349/functions_of_session_layer3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750482160/functions_of_session_layer4.webp)![functions_of_session_layer4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750482160/functions_of_session_layer4.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750678631/functions_of_session_layer5.webp)![functions_of_session_layer5.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750678631/functions_of_session_layer5.webp)\n\n![functions_of_session_layer6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750904704/functions_of_session_layer6.webp)![functions_of_session_layer6.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127175750904704/functions_of_session_layer6.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 7\n\n### 1\\. Session Establishment\n\nThe basic and most important function of the session layer is to establish a connection between the communicating parties known as sessions. This connection helps to transfer the data such as files, remote login, and communication over these sessions in a more ordered and reliable way. The session layer can establish connection-oriented as well as connectionless sessions. Whenever any session is released, the transport connection is also released. Sessions can be mapped onto transport connections in three ways. They are:\n\n- One-to-one mapping: In one-to-one mapping, one transport connection is being used by one session.\n- Many-to-one mapping: In many-to-one mapping, the same transport connection is being used by the consecutive sessions.\n- One-to-many mapping: In one-to-many mapping, multiple transport connections are used by one session.\n\n### 2\\. Communication Synchronization\n\nThe session layer provides proper connectivity among the systems, during this if any occurs, a recovery option known as the state is provided. For using the known state session layer adds synchronization bits in every state of the error and these bits are then used as checkpoints. For longer and complex communications the checkpoints are added to the data stream. It makes sure that data streams are received successfully and acknowledged up to the checkpoints. If any failure occurs then only the stream is retransmitted after the checkpoints. The functionality is being provided by the session layer because transport layer can mask only the communication errors, not the upper layer errors.\n\n### 3\\. Activity Management\n\nThe session layer provides with the feature for users to differentiate among the activities that are performed during the session. The message stream can split into logical units and these logical units are known as an activities. Activity management is defined as a process of splitting of message stream into activities.\n\n### 4\\. Dialog Management\n\nDialog management is defined as a process of keeping log data for the connections established for transmitting and receiving data. It is required for establishing, synchronization, preserving and ending of the conversation between the communicating parties namely sender and the receiver. For this a mechanism known as token mechanism is being used in which a user that is sharing the data is given a token if it is in half duplex mode and after the exchange it is transferred to the the another device. If the operation is in full duplex mode then no token is used for transmission of data. The efficiency of the connection is maintained if token mechanism is used.\n\n### 5\\. Data Transfer\n\nData transfer is also one of the basic and important function of session layer. Session layer handles the exchange of data between the communicating systems. This exchange of data between the users can be in two modes of transmission. They are:\n\n- Half-duplex mode: In half duplex mode of transmission of data only one user has right for initiating the data transfer.\n- Full- duplex mode: In full duplex mode of transmission data can be transmitted in both the directions simultaneously.\n\n### 6\\. Resynchronization\n\nResynchronisation is also known as backward synchronization. Resynchronisation is defined as a process in which the state of dialog is being restored to its previously defined state. After the resynchronization all the tokens are restored to the positions that were set during synchronization. There are various options of resynchronisation. They are:\n\n- Set: Set option is being used for setting the synchronization point serial number to any value that is being chosen by the user.\n- Abandon: Abandon option is being used for setting the synchronization point serial number to an unused value.\n- Restart: Restart option is being used for setting the synchronization point serial number o any of the used value that is grater than the synchronization point serial number which identifies the last acknowledged major synchronization point.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Q.1: Which layer lies above the session layer of OSI model?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Presentation layer lies above the [session layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/session-layer-in-osi-model/) of [OSI model.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) Presentation layer prepares the data for its upper layer. It states about how the devices should encode, encrypt and compress the data.\n\n### Q.2: Which layers of OSI model are known as software layers or upper layers?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> The session layer, presentation layer and application layer are known as the software or upper layers of OSI model.\n\n### Q.3: What is meant by session termination?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Session termination is defined as a process of ending the session communication. This process of session termination is important because it releases the resources and makes sure that both the communicating devices know that session has been ended.\n\n### Q.4: Can applications interact directly with session layer?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> No, applications cannot directly interact with the session layer.

This layer is also known as **Translation layer**, as this layer serves as a data translator for the network. The data which this layer receives from the Application Layer is extracted and manipulated here as per the required format to transmit over the network. The main responsibility of this layer is to provide or define the data format and encryption. The presentation layer is also called as **Syntax layer** since it is responsible for maintaining the proper syntax of the data which it either receives or transmits to other layer(s).\n\n![2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127104353989955/2.webp)\n\nPresentation Layer in OSI Model\n\n## **Functions of Presentation Layer**\n\nThe presentation layer performs several types of functions such as data translation, compression, encryption/decryption etc.\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849367289/functions_of_presentation_layer.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849367289/functions_of_presentation_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849513798/functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849513798/functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849666128/functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849666128/functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849813940/functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849813940/functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849968563/functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849968563/functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 5\n\n## **Services Provided by Presentation Layer**\n\nPresentation layer plays an important role while communication is taking place between two devices in a network.\n\nList of services which are provided by the presentation layer are:\n\n- Presentation layer could apply certain sophisticated compression techniques, so fewer bytes of data are required to represent the information when it is sent over the network.\n\n- If two or more devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, then this presentation layer is responsible for adding encryption on the sender\u2019s end as well as the decoding the encryption on the receiver\u2019s end so that it can represent the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.\n\n- This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent over a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems.\n\n- This presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to the session layer (which is the 5th layer in the OSI model) and thus improves the speed as well as the efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of the data to be transferred.\n\n- This presentation layer also negotiates the Transfer Syntax.\n\nRead more about [Services Provided by Presentation Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-services/)\n\n## **Working of Presentation Layer**\n\nHere\u2019s how presentation layer works:\n\n- **Data Translation**: Converts data into a standardized format (e.g., EBCDIC to ASCII).\n- **Data Compression**: Reduces data size to optimize bandwidth and speed.\n- **Data Encryption/Decryption**: Secures data during transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS).\n- **Syntax and Semantics**: Ensures data is interpreted correctly across systems.\n- **Interoperability**: Bridges differences in data formats between devices.\n\n## **Presentation Layer Protocols**\n\nPresentation Layer, for performing translations or other specified functions, needs to use certain protocols which are defined below \u2013\n\n- [**Apple Filing Protocol (AFP):**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/afp-fullform/) Apple Filing Protocol is the proprietary network protocol (communications protocol) that offers services to macOS or the classic macOS. This is basically the network file control protocol specifically designed for Mac-based platforms.\n- **Lightweight Presentation Protocol (LPP):** Lightweight Presentation Protocol is that protocol which is used to provide ISO presentation services on the top of TCP/IP based protocol stacks.\n- [**NetWare Core Protocol (NCP):**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-novell-netware/) NetWare Core Protocol is the network protocol which is used to access file, print, directory, clock synchronization, messaging, remote command execution and other network service functions.\n- **Network Data Representation (NDR):** Network Data Representation is basically the implementation of the presentation layer in the OSI model, which provides or defines various primitive data types, constructed data types and also several types of data representations.\n- **External Data Representation (XDR):** External Data Representation (XDR) is the standard for the description and encoding of data. It is useful for transferring data between computer architectures and has been used to communicate data between very diverse machines. Converting from local representation to XDR is called encoding, whereas converting XDR into local representation is called decoding.\n- [**Secure Socket Layer (SSL):**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) The Secure Socket Layer protocol provides security to the data that is being transferred between the web browser and the server. SSL encrypts the link between a web server and a browser, which ensures that all data passed between them remains private and free from attacks.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Presentation Layer in OSI Model \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n**What are the presentation layer attacks?**\n\n> Presentation layer attacks exploit the vulnerabilities in how data is formatted, encrypted, compressed, or transmitted between systems. Common attacks include:\n>\n> - [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attack/): Interception of data during transmission to steal sensitive information like login credentials or financial details.\n> - SSL/TLS Downgrade Attacks: Forcing a connection to use weaker encryption protocols, making it easier to decrypt the data.\n> - Certificate Spoofing: Using fake or compromised security certificates to impersonate a trusted entity and gain access to sensitive data.\n> - [Code Injection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-injection-vulnerability-mitigation/): Exploiting vulnerabilities in data parsing or translation\n\n**What is TLS in presentation layer?**\n\n> **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a cryptographic protocol that operates at the **Presentation Layer**. It ensures secure communication between devices by encrypting data, maintaining its integrity, and providing authentication.\n\n**What is SSL vs TLS?**\n\n> **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** and **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** are protocols for securing communication. TLS is the modern, more secure successor to SSL. While SSL (now outdated) had vulnerabilities, TLS improves encryption, authentication, and overall security. TLS is widely used for secure web browsing, replacing SSL.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Application Layer in OSI Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/u5jzqgea1vql16pxwkwg)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/amansingla/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[amansingla](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/amansingla/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n32\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It receives data from the Application layer and manipulate it in required format to transmit over the network. Then main purpose of the [presentation layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/) of the OSI model is to translate data into an acceptable format usable by the application layer.\u00a0Hence, it is also known as Translation layer.\n\n## Services Offered by Presentation Layer\n\nData flows as packets of code through networks and these packets are often encrypted. To present it in a useful format is the focus of presentation layer. It majorly delas with :\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849367289/functions_of_presentation_layer.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849367289/functions_of_presentation_layer.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849513798/functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849513798/functions_of_presentation_layer_1.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849666128/functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849666128/functions_of_presentation_layer_2.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849813940/functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849813940/functions_of_presentation_layer_3.webp)\n\n![functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849968563/functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp)![functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250127151849968563/functions_of_presentation_layer_4.webp)\n\nPreviousPauseNext1 / 5\n\n### 1.Data Translation\n\nWhen the sender and receiver's device understand different formats of code, then the data needs to be translated from one format to another so that the receiver understands data effectively, this process is known as data translation. The characters of the alphabet convert via a character coding system, such as :\n\n- American Standard Code for Information Interchange ( [ASCII](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ascii-and-ebcdic/))\n- Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code ( [EBCDIC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ascii-and-ebcdic/))\n\nExample: Data in ASCII format from sender gets converted into EBCDIC format as the receiver can only understand EBCDIC and not ASCII.\n\n### 2.Data Compression\n\n[Data Compression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-data-compression-techniques/) is often used to maximize the use of bandwidth across a network and speeds up data transfer. The presentation layer compresses data at the sender's side and decompresses it at the receiver's side. There are two general types of compression algorithms:\n\n![types_of_compression](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128175128827894/types_of_compression.webp)Types of Data Compression\n\n**1\\. Lossless compression :** There is no loss of data during lossless compression and when data is decompressed it is exactly same as it was before compression. It doesn't generally compress as much as lossy compression and may take more processing power. Example: ZIP files for text\n\n**2\\. Lossy compression** : It does not promise that the data received is exactly the same as data send i.e. the data may be lost. Example: JPEG for images\n\nRead more about [Lossless vs Lossy Compression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-lossy-compression-and-lossless-compression/).\n\n### 3.Data Encryption/Decryption\n\nPresentation layer ensure that data is secure from any modification or attack during transmission by encrypting it into unreadable form( [ciphertext](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-cipher/)) on the sender's side and decrypting it into original message(plaintext) at the receiver's end. If any hacker tries to hack the data, then the hacker gets an encrypted data and if any modification is done, it can be detected during decryption at the receiver's end.\n\n![Untitled-Diagram-84](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128175241660040/Untitled-Diagram-84.png)Data Encryption and Decryption\n\nExample: Protocols like [SSL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secure-socket-layer-ssl/) (Secure Sockets Layer) handle encryption and decryption to protect sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, over the network.\n\nRead more about [Data Encryption and Decryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-encryption-and-decryption/).\n\n### 4.Syntax and Semantics Management\n\nSyntax and semantics management ensures that data exchanged between systems is both correctly formatted and meaningful. **Syntax** refers to the structure or format of the data, such as the arrangement of characters, numbers, or symbols. The presentation layer ensures that the data follows the expected format so the receiving system can understand it. **Semantics**, on the other hand, deals with the meaning of the data. The presentation layer ensures that the data retains its intended meaning when interpreted by the receiving system. This is especially important when systems use different data representations, such as encoding numerical values or character sets differently.\n\nExample: Converting data between formats like [XML](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-json-and-xml/) or [JSON](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-json/) to ensures compatibility between different systems.\n\n## Limitations of Presentation Layer Services\n\n- Presentation layer has limited error handling and rely on lower layer, like [Transport layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-in-osi-model/) to handle errors.\n- If the application layers of communicating systems use incompatible protocols or formats not supported by the Presentation Layer, data may still fail to be interpreted correctly.\n- Additional processing overhead due to translation, compression, and encryption.\n- It can't directly manage network communication and rely on lower layers for data transfer.\n- The effectiveness of the Presentation Layer's services is limited by the specific protocols it supports (e.g., [SSL/TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/), [MIME](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multipurpose-internet-mail-extension-mime-protocol/)) and their respective capabilities.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Presentation Layer Services \u2013 FAQs\n\n**Does the Presentation Layer deal with error correction?**\n\n> No, the Presentation Layer does not handle error correction. Error handling is managed by the lower layers, such as the [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-in-osi-model/).\n\n**Is the Presentation Layer necessary for all communication?**\n\n> The [Presentation Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/) is important for some types of communication where data needs to be converted into different formats, encrypted, or compressed. However, for simple data where both systems use the same format, this layer may not be actively involved.\n\n**Which protocols work at the presentation layer?**\n\n> Protocols that work at the Presentation Layer include [**SSL/TLS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-secure-socket-layer-ssl-and-transport-layer-security-tls/) for encryption, **JPEG, GIF, and PNG** for image compression, and [**MIME**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multipurpose-internet-mail-extension-mime-protocol/) for email content encoding\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Presentation Layer in OSI model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/presentation-layer-in-osi-model/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anushkadaym/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[anushkadaym](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/anushkadaym/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Presentation Layer Services\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Presentation layer is the 6th layer in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model.

It provides wide networking services ranging from easy and simple file to network user, data, security, and even resource management. It is generally designed for networks or [Local Area Network (LAN)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/) operating system.\n\n**Novell NetWare** is most popular and widely used network system in PC world. Novell NetWare is simply designed to get used by various companies downsizing from mainframe to network of PCs. It only needs low hardware requirements and has memory protection. It keeps safe and protects single processes from each other. Novell NetWare is discontinued network operating system basically developed by Novell, Inc.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, it is one of most powerful networks operating systems. It generally uses proprietary protocol stack as shown in below diagram. Novell NetWare 6.5 is one of Novell\u2019s most current network operating system used nowadays.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717224308/7899.png)\n\n**Protocols in Novell Netware :**\n\n- **Internet Package Exchange (IPX) \u2013**\n\n\nNetwork layer generally runs unreliable connectionless internetwork protocol. It is called Internet Package Exchange (IPX) protocol. This protocol is simply used for routing and showing path to packets to move from one network node to another network throughout internetwork.\n\n\nFormat of IPX is shown below:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717224445/j16.png)\n\n- **NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) \u2013**\n\n\nNCP is type of network protocol that is used in many products from Novell, Inc. It is actually Novell client-server protocol used for mainly Local Area Network (LAN). It is generally connected to NetWare Operating systems (OS). It also works with alternating operating systems along with UNIX, Linux, and Windows NT.\n\n\n- **Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX) \u2013**\n\n\nSPX is also type of network protocol that is used by Novell Netware. SPX is also supported by other operating systems. It is nowadays considered legacy protocol as it has largely been replaced by TCP/IP. This protocol is simply used for handling packet sequencing in Novell Netware network.\n\n\n**Features of Novell Netware :**\n\nMost important features of Netware are following:\n\n- **Directory Service \u2013**\n\n\nNovell Directory Service (NDS) is distributed directory service mainly used for managing network resources such as users, servers, and peripherals. It is originally known as NetWare Directory Services. It uses NDS for resource access and authentication. Directory service of networking operating system allows and enables users to identify and find network resources that are required. There are basically three types of Directory services of Novell Netware such as Bindery, NDS, EDirectory.\n\n- **User Interface \u2013**\n\n\nIt contains simple user interface by which user and computer system can interact in easy way.\n\n- **Hardware requirements \u2013**\n\n\nThis network operating system does not require or needs many hardware devices. It needs very minimal hardware devices.\n\n- **Interoperability \u2013**\n\n\nUsing this networking operating system, ability of computer systems or software to simply exchange and make use of information with many types of computer systems is increased.\n\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-netcat/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction to Netcat](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-netcat/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/du61fs4hehkbo38xrshz)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[madhurihammad](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/madhurihammad/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Introduction of Novell NetWare\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nNovell NetWare is type of Network Operating System.

It was created by Netscape in 1995 to ensure privacy, authentication, and data integrity in online communications. SSL is the older version of what we now call [TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/) (Transport Layer Security).\n\nWebsites using SSL/TLS have \u201c [HTTPS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-working-of-https/)\u201d in their URL instead of \u201c [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/).\u201d\n\n## Working of SSL\n\n- **Encryption**: SSL encrypts data transmitted over the web, ensuring privacy. If someone intercepts the data, they will see only a jumble of characters that is nearly impossible to decode.\n- **Authentication**: SSL starts an authentication process called a handshake between two devices to confirm their identities, making sure both parties are who they claim to be.\n- **Data Integrity**: SSL [digitally signs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-electronic-signature-and-digital-signature/) data to ensure it hasn\u2019t been tampered with, verifying that the data received is exactly what was sent by the sender.\n\n## Importance of SSL\n\nOriginally, data on the web was transmitted in plaintext, making it easy for anyone who intercepted the message to read it. For example, if someone logged into their email account, their username and password would travel across the Internet unprotected.\n\nSSL was created to solve this problem and protect user privacy. By encrypting data between a user and a web server, SSL ensures that anyone who intercepts the data sees only a scrambled mess of characters. This keeps the user\u2019s login credentials safe, visible only to the email service.\n\nAdditionally, SSL helps prevent cyber attacks by:\n\n- **Authenticating Web Servers**: Ensuring that users are connecting to the legitimate website, not a fake one set up by attackers.\n- **Preventing Data Tampering**: Acting like a tamper-proof seal, SSL ensures that the data sent and received hasn\u2019t been altered during transit.\n\n## Secure Socket Layer Protocols\n\n1. SSL Record Protocol\n2. Handshake Protocol\n3. Change-Cipher Spec Protocol\n4. Alert Protocol\n\n![SSL Protocols](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190610161956/161.jpg)\n\n### **SSL Record Protocol**\n\nSSL Record provides two services to SSL connection.\n\n- Confidentiality\n- Message Integrity\n\nIn the SSL Record Protocol application data is divided into fragments. The fragment is compressed and then encrypted MAC (Message Authentication Code) generated by algorithms like SHA ( [Secure Hash Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-1-hash-in-java/)) and MD5 ( [Message Digest](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-md5-algorithm/)) is appended. After that encryption of the data is done and in last SSL header is appended to the data.\n\n### ![SSL Record Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190610162031/171.jpg)Handshake Protocol\n\nHandshake Protocol is used to establish sessions. This protocol allows the client and server to authenticate each other by sending a series of messages to each other. Handshake protocol uses four phases to complete its cycle.\n\n- **Phase-1:** In Phase-1 both Client and Server send hello-packets to each other. In this IP session, cipher suite and protocol version are exchanged for security purposes.\n- **Phase-2:** Server sends it certificate and Server-key-exchange. The server end phase-2 by sending the Server-hello-end packet.\n- **Phase-3:** In this phase, Client replies to the server by sending it certificate and Client-exchange-key.\n- **Phase-4:** In Phase-4 Change Cipher Spec occurs and after this the Handshake Protocol ends.\n\n\n![Handshake Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220606010323/SSLHandshakeDiagByakhilabhilash01.png)\n\nSSL Handshake Protocol Phases diagrammatic representation\n\n### Change-Cipher Protocol\n\nThis protocol uses the SSL record protocol. Unless [Handshake](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/) Protocol is completed, the SSL record Output will be in a pending state. After the handshake protocol, the Pending state is converted into the current state.\n\nChange-cipher protocol consists of a single message which is 1 byte in length and can have only one value. This protocol\u2019s purpose is to cause the pending state to be copied into the current state.\n\n![Change Cypher Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190610162156/181.jpg)\n\n### Alert Protocol\n\nThis protocol is used to convey SSL-related alerts to the peer entity. Each message in this protocol contains 2 bytes.\n\n![Alert Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190610162236/191.jpg)\n\nThe level is further classified into two parts:\n\n**Warning (level = 1)**\n\nThis Alert has no impact on the connection between sender and receiver.\u00a0Some of them are:\n\n- **Bad Certificate:** When the received certificate is corrupt.\n- **No Certificate:** When an appropriate certificate is not available.\n- **Certificate Expired:** When a certificate has expired.\n- **Certificate Unknown:** When some other unspecified issue arose in processing the certificate, rendering it unacceptable.\n- **Close Notify**: It notifies that the sender will no longer send any messages in the connection.\n- **Unsupported Certificate:** The type of certificate received is not supported.\n- **Certificate Revoked:** The certificate received is in revocation list.\n\n**Fatal Error (level = 2):**\n\nThis Alert breaks the connection between sender and receiver. The connection will be stopped, cannot be resumed but can be restarted. Some of them are :\n\n- **Handshake Failure:** When the sender is unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security parameters given the options available.\n- **Decompression Failure**: When the decompression function receives improper input.\n- **Illegal Parameters:** When a field is out of range or inconsistent with other fields.\n- **Bad Record MAC:** When an incorrect MAC was received.\n- **Unexpected Message:** When an inappropriate message is received.\n\nThe second byte in the Alert protocol describes the error.\n\n## Salient Features of Secure Socket Layer\n\n- The advantage of this approach is that the service can be tailored to the specific needs of the given application.\n- Secure Socket Layer was originated by Netscape.\n- SSL is designed to make use of TCP to provide reliable end-to-end secure service.\n- This is a two-layered protocol.\n\n## **Versions of SSL**\n\nSSL 1 \u2013 Never released due to high insecurity\n\nSSL 2 \u2013 Released in 1995\n\nSSL 3 \u2013 Released in 1996\n\nTLS 1.0\u00a0\u2013 Released in 1999\n\nTLS \u00a01.1 \u2013 Released in 2006\n\nTLS 1.2 \u2013 Released in 2008\n\nTLS 1.3 \u2013 Released in 2018\n\n## SSL Certificate\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate used to secure and verify the identity of a website or an online service. The certificate is issued by a trusted third-party called a Certificate Authority (CA), who verifies the identity of the website or service before issuing the certificate.\n\nThe SSL certificate has several important characteristics that make it a reliable solution for securing online transactions :\n\n- **Encryption**: The SSL certificate uses encryption algorithms to secure the communication between the website or service and its users. This ensures that the sensitive information, such as login credentials and credit card information, is protected from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.\n- **Authentication**: The SSL certificate verifies the identity of the website or service, ensuring that users are communicating with the intended party and not with an impostor. This provides assurance to users that their information is being transmitted to a trusted entity.\n- **Integrity**: The SSL certificate uses message authentication codes (MACs) to detect any tampering with the data during transmission. This ensures that the data being transmitted is not modified in any way, preserving its integrity.\n- **Non-repudiation**: SSL certificates provide non-repudiation of data, meaning that the recipient of the data cannot deny having received it. This is important in situations where the authenticity of the information needs to be established, such as in e-commerce transactions.\n- **Public-key cryptography:** SSL certificates use public-key cryptography for secure key exchange between the client and server. This allows the client and server to securely exchange encryption keys, ensuring that the encrypted information can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.\n- **Session management**: SSL certificates allow for the management of secure sessions, allowing for the resumption of secure sessions after interruption. This helps to reduce the overhead of establishing a new secure connection each time a user accesses a website or service.\n- **Certificates issued by trusted CAs**: SSL certificates are issued by trusted CAs, who are responsible for verifying the identity of the website or service before issuing the certificate. This provides a high level of trust and assurance to users that the website or service they are communicating with is authentic and trustworthy.\n\nIn addition to these key characteristics, SSL certificates also come in various [levels of validation](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100792081/type/dlg/https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/domain-validation/), including Domain Validation (DV), Organization Validation (OV), and Extended Validation (EV). The level of validation determines the amount of information that is verified by the CA before issuing the certificate, with EV certificates providing the highest level of assurance and trust to users. For more information about SSL certificates for each Validation level type, please refer to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/domain-validation/?utm_source=CJ&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=100792081&ref=cj&affnetwork=cj&cjevent=276eb3d21a5d11ee81e902110a18ba73).\n\nOverall, the SSL certificate is an important component of online security, providing encryption, authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and other key features that ensure the secure and reliable transmission of sensitive information over the internet.\n\n## Types of SSL Certificates\n\nThere are different types of SSL certificates, each suited for different needs:\n\n- **Single-Domain SSL Certificate**: This type covers only one specific domain. A domain is the name of a website, like www.geeksforgeeks.org. For instance, if you have a single-domain SSL certificate for www.geeksforgeeks.org, it won\u2019t cover any other domains or subdomains.\n- **Wildcard SSL Certificate**: Similar to a single-domain certificate, but it also covers all subdomains of a single domain. For example, if you have a wildcard certificate for \\*.geeksforgeeks.org, it would cover www.geeksforgeeks.org, blog.www.geeksforgeeks.org, and any other subdomain under example.com.\n- **Multi-Domain SSL Certificate**: This type can secure multiple unrelated domains within a single certificate.\n\nThese certificates vary in scope and flexibility, allowing website owners to choose the appropriate level of security coverage based on their needs.\n\nSSL certificates have different validation levels, which determine how thoroughly a business or organization is vetted:\n\n- **Domain Validation (DV)**: This is the simplest and least expensive level. To get a DV certificate, a business just needs to prove it owns the domain (like www.geeksforgeeks.org).\n- **Organization Validation (OV)**: This involves a more hands-on verification process. The [Certificate Authority](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digital-signatures-certificates/)(CA) directly contacts the organization to confirm its identity before issuing the certificate. OV certificates provide more assurance to users about the legitimacy of the organization.\n- **Extended Validation (EV)**: This is the most rigorous level of validation. It requires a comprehensive background check of the organization to ensure it\u2019s legitimate and trustworthy. EV certificates are recognized by the green address bar in web browsers, indicating the highest level of security and trustworthiness.\n\nThese validation levels help users understand the level of security and trust they can expect when visiting websites secured with SSL certificates.\n\n## Are SSL and TLS the Same thing?\n\nSSL is the direct predecessor of TLS (Transport Layer Security). In 1999, the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/importance-of-internet-standardization/)(IETF) proposed an update to SSL. Since this update was developed by the IETF without Netscape\u2019s involvement, the name was changed to TLS. The changes between the last version of SSL (3.0) and the first version of TLS were not significant; the name change mainly signified new ownership.\n\nBecause SSL and TLS are so similar, people often use the terms interchangeably. Some still call it SSL, while others use \u201cSSL/TLS encryption\u201d since SSL is still widely recognized.\n\n## Check SSL Version\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer) hasn\u2019t been updated since SSL 3.0 back in 1996 and is now considered outdated. It has known vulnerabilities, so security experts advise against using it. Most modern web browsers no longer support SSL.\n\nTLS ( [Transport Layer Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/)) is the current encryption protocol used online. Despite this, many still refer to it as \u201cSSL encryption,\u201d causing confusion when people look for security solutions. Nowadays, any vendor offering \u201cSSL\u201d is likely providing TLS protection, which has been the standard for over 20 years. The term \u201cSSL protection\u201d is still used widely on product pages because many users still search for it.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Secure Socket Layer \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Is SSL still used today?**\n\n> While SSL has been largely replaced by TLS, many people still use the term \u201cSSL\u201d to refer to both protocols due to SSL\u2019s name recognition.\n\n### **What happens if a website does not use SSL?**\n\n> If a website does not use SSL, data transmitted between the user and the website is sent in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception and attacks.\n\n### **Can SSL prevent all types of cyber attacks?**\n\n> SSL cannot prevent all types of cyber attacks. It primarily secures data in transit but does not protect against threats like malware or phishing attacks\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-lan-man-and-wan/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Difference between LAN, MAN and WAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-lan-man-and-wan/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/SakshiBhakhra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[SakshiBhakhra](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/SakshiBhakhra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Spotlight](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/spotlight/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Cyber Security Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCyber security, also known as information technology security, refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.

A distributed information system consists of multiple autonomous computers that communicate or exchange information through a computer network. There are three ways by which entities in the distributed systems communicate:\n\n- Interprocess Communication: It is a low-level communication paradigm. Examples are: Distributed shared memory like a mailbox\n- Remote Invocation: It is a high-level and direct communication paradigm. Examples are: RPC, RMI, etc\n- Indirect Communication: It is a high-level indirect communication paradigm. Examples are: Group communication, Publish/Subscribe model, etc\n\nRPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. In RPC, a computer program causes a procedure to operate in a different address space, and it is programmed as if it were a normal procedure call. \u00a0Whether the subroutine is local to the current program or remote, the programmer writes essentially the same code. A request-response message-passing mechanism is generally used to accomplish this type of client-server interaction. It\u2019s preferable to think of it as a generic structure for distributed systems. RPC is popular because it is built on the semantics of a local procedure call: the application software makes a call to a procedure, regardless of whether it is local or remote, and waits for it to return. \u00a0RPCs are represented via remote method invocation in the object-oriented programming paradigm.\n\nTheoretical suggestions of remote procedure calls as the paradigm of network operations come from the 1970s, while actual implementations emerge from the early 1980s. In 1981, Bruce Jay Nelson is credited with coining the term \u2018Remote procedure call\u2019. It is widely used in:\n\n- Protobufs (Google)\n- Thrift on Facebook\n- Finagle on Twitter\n\nRPC aims to make network communication appear as if it were a function call. An application developer\u2019s job can be considerably simplified if he is entirely unaware of whether an operation is local or remote. When the procedures being called are methods of objects in an object-oriented language, RPC is known as a remote method invocation. While the RPC concept is simple, it has some flaws listed below:\n\n- The network between the calling and called processes is prone to limit message sizes and has a proclivity for losing and reordering messages.\n- The calling and called processes may operate on machines with vastly different architectures and data representation types.\n\n### **RPC mechanism consists of two key components:**\n\n- A protocol that controls the messages delivered between the client and server processes and deals with the underlying network\u2019s possibly unfavorable characteristics.\n- The arguments are packaged into a request message on the client computer, which is then translated back into the arguments on the server machine, and the return value is translated back into the parameters. A stub compiler is a name given to this part of the RPC system.\n- Client-server request lost\n- Server-client reply lost\n- Server crashes after receiving a request\n- Client crashes after delivering the request\n\nThe fundamental algorithm is easy to understand. The client sends a request message, which is acknowledged by the server. The server then sends a reply message after completing the operation, which the client acknowledges.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210913113025/Untitleddrawing1-660x495.jpg)\n\nRPC timeline\n\n**Following steps are followed in the RPC mechanism:**\n\n- Each RPC takes place within a thread. A thread is a single control flow that has just one point of execution at any one time. An application thread is a thread that is generated and maintained by application code.\n- Both RPCs and RPC run-time calls are issued by RPC apps using application threads. One or more client application threads, each of which can conduct one or more RPCs, make up an RPC client.\n- In addition, an RPC server employs one or more call threads provided by the RPC run-time framework to execute called remote operations. The server application thread sets the maximum number of concurrent calls it will execute when it starts listening.\n- There is only one call thread in single-threaded programs. In multi-threaded applications, the maximum number of call threads is determined by the application\u2019s architecture and RPC implementation policies. The call threads are created in the server execution context by the RPC run-time mechanism.\n- An RPC can be used in both client and server environments. As a result, when a client application thread contacts a remote procedure, it becomes part of an RPC thread, which is a logical thread of execution.\n- An RPC thread is a conceptual construct that extends over real execution threads and the network to include the different phases of an RPC.\n- The calling client application thread joins the RPC thread after making an RPC. Until the call returns, the RPC thread usually retains execution control.\n- The RPC thread of a successful RPC passes through the execution stages depicted in RPC Thread Execution Phases.\n- The following items are included in the execution phase:\n  - The RPC thread starts in the client process when a client application thread makes an RPC to its stub; the client thread then joins the RPC thread.\n  - The RPC thread connects to the server across the network.\n  - The RPC thread becomes a calling thread, which runs the remote procedure.\n  - The calling thread becomes part of the RPC thread when a called remote operation is running.\n  - When the call completes, the calling thread is no longer part of the RPC thread.\n  - The RPC thread then returns to the client via the network.\n  - When the RPC thread reaches the calling client application thread, it delivers any call results, and the client application +thread exits the RPC thread.\n\n### **Getting Around Network Limitations:**\n\nTo deal with the reality that networks aren\u2019t ideal conduits, RPC protocols frequently perform extra duties. There are two such functions:\n\n- Deliver messages in a timely manner.\n- Fragmentation and reassembly are used to support huge message sizes.\n\nIn most situations, the RCP protocol builds its own reliable message delivery layer on top of an unreliable substrate (e.g., UDP/IP). Similar to TCP, such an RPC protocol would most likely implement dependability using acknowledgements and timeouts.\n\n### **Benefits of RPC:**\n\n- Process-oriented and thread-oriented architectures are both supported by remote procedure calls.\n- Remote procedure calls can be utilized in both a distributed and a local context.\n- The user is not aware of RPC\u2019s underlying message transmission method.\n- To enhance performance, RPC skips several of the protocol layers.\n- In remote procedure calls, the work required to rewrite and develop the code is minimal.\n\n### **Drawbacks of RPC:**\n\n- The notion of a remote procedure call can be implemented in a variety of ways. It isn\u2019t a set of rules.\n- RPC does not allow for hardware architectural flexibility. It is solely dependent on interaction.\n- Costs have increased as a result of the remote procedure call.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/email-protocols/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Email Protocols](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/email-protocols/?ref=next_article)\n\n[E](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/error_502/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[error\\_502](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/error_502/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[RPC Message Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe distributed information system is defined as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a number of interdependent computers linked by a network for sharing information among them\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.

It is Developed by Microsoft and other tech companies in the 1990s It is one of the first protocols used for Virtual Private Networks VPNs. A PPTP works by establishing a tunnel between two points allowing users to securely connect to private networks from remote locations.\n\nThis protocol essentially creates a direct and private pathway for data transmission making it appear as if the remote user is directly connected to a private network even when accessing it from anywhere in the world through the internet.\n\n## What is PPTP?\n\nThe PPTP means a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. The PPTP is a networking standard for connecting to a virtual private network VPN. These are secure networks that can be accessed over the Internet allowing the users to access the network from a remote location. This is useful for a people who need to connect to an other network from one location to another location.\n\nthe \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d term refers to the connection generated by PPTP. It allows one point to access another determined point over the [Internet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-internet/). The \u201ctunneling\u201d term refers to the way one protocol/Algorithm is encapsulated within another respective one. In PPTP, the point-to-point protocol is wrapped inside the [TCP/IP protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-in-computer-networking/), which provides the Internet connection. Therefore, even though the connection is created over the Internet, the PPTP connection makes a direct link between the two clients/locations, giving a secure connection. PPTP is fast due to its low level of encryption and it is capable of offering fast connectivity.\n\n## How does PPTP work?\n\nPPTP is an improved version of PPP, on the basis of its authentication and encryption framework. Like all the tunneling technologies PPTP is used to encapsulate data creating a route for data to flow across the IP network. This PPTP uses a client-server design that operates at Layer 2 of an OSI model. Once a VPN tunnel is established, PPTP supports two types of information flow, one is the Control messages for managing and eventually tearing down the VPN connection.\n\nControl messages pass directly between VPN client and server. The other one being Data packets that pass through the tunnel, i.e. to or from the VPN client. PPTP uses [General Routing Encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre-tunnel/), [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) port 1723, and IP port 47. PPTP supports encryption keys up to 128-bits, and it uses Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption.\n\n**The most secured versions of PPTP is to exclusively use:**\n\n- MPPE-128 encryption which uses [RC4 encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rc4-encryption-algorithm/) with a 128bit key.\n- MS-CHAPv2 authentication which uses [SHA-1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-1-hash-in-java/).\n- Strong Passwords.\n\n## Types of Tunneling\n\n### Voluntary Tunneling\n\nIn this client-initiated approach, the user\u2019s device creates and manages the VPN connection directly. It offers greater control to the end-user but requires manual configuration, making it popular for personal VPN use and remote work scenarios.\n\n### Compulsory Tunneling\n\nThis server-initiated method automatically establishes the VPN connection as soon as the user connects to the internet. It provides centralized control for organizations, ensuring all traffic passes through the VPN, but requires network infrastructure support and may impact connection flexibility.\n\n## Advantages of PPTP\n\n- PPTP is a very fast VPN protocol.\n- PPTP is really easy to set up and configure on most operating systems and devices.\n- Due to the protocol\u2019s high rate of cross-platform compatibility, a PPTP connection can be established on tons of platforms.\n- **Lower Transmission Costs:**\u00a0No additional service used, other than the Internet.\n- **Reduces hardware costs:**\u00a0Allows ISDN cards and modems to be separated from other [servers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-server/), which results in fewer devices to purchase and manage.\n- **Low Administrative Overhead:**\u00a0Administrators only manage the remote access server (RAS) and user accounts, rather than managing different hardware configurations.\n- **Enhanced Security:**\u00a0PPTP connection is encrypted and secured over the Internet and works with other networking protocols, like IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange and NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI).\n\n## Disadvantages of PPTP\n\n- PPTP encryption is sub-par and not suitable for securing online data and traffic. The NSA has actually cracked PPTP traffic.\n- A PPTP connection can be exploited by cybercriminals with malicious attacks.\n- A [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) with PPTP Passthrough is usually required since PPTP doesn\u2019t natively work with NAT.\n- A PPTP connection can be blocked quite easily by firewalls.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA PPTP is an old [VPN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vpn-and-how-it-works/) protocol that is easy to set up and widely compatible. It offers a fast connections but has a weak security. While it might work for basic needs, it\u2019s not recommended for sensitive data or high-security requirements. More modern VPN protocols generally provide better protection and features, making them preferable for most users today.\n\n![PPTP-Full-Form](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200505202656/PPTP.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on PPTP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the main purpose of PPTP?\n\n> PPTP main purpose is to create a secure connections over a internet allowing remote users to access private networks safely. It acts as a virtual tunnel that protects data as it travels between the user device and a private network.\n\n### Is PPTP still used today?\n\n> PPTP is available and supported by many devices its less secure than modern VPN protocols. Some organizations still use it due to its simplicity and compatibility with older systems but its replaced by newer protocols.\n\n### What security features does PPTP provide?\n\n> PPTP provides basic encryption and authentication features to protect data during transmission. It uses passwords and encryption algorithms to ensure that only authorized users can access the private network connection.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-point-to-point-protocol-works/?ref=next_article)\n\n[How Point To Point Protocol Works?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-point-to-point-protocol-works/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sudeepharry357/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[sudeepharry357](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sudeepharry357/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n- [Full Form](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/full-form/?ref=article_category)\n- [Write From Home](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/write-from-home/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[PPTP Full Form - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPPTP Stands for Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is a widely used networking protocol designed to create a secure private connection over a public network like the internet.

It allows the users to exchange different kinds of data files on the Internet: audio, video, images, application programs as well.\n\n**Why do we need MIME?**\n\nLimitations of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):\n\n1. SMTP has a very simple structure\n2. Its simplicity however comes with a price as it only sends messages in NVT 7-bit ASCII format.\n3. It cannot be used for languages that do not support 7-bit ASCII format such as French, German, Russian, Chinese and Japanese, etc. so it cannot be transmitted using SMTP. So, in order _to make SMTP more broad_, _we use MIME_.\n4. It cannot be used to send binary files or video or audio data.\n\n**Purpose and Functionality of MIME \u2013**\n\nGrowing demand for Email Messages as people also want to express themselves in terms of Multimedia. So, MIME another email application is introduced as it is not restricted to textual data.\n\nMIME _transforms non-ASCII data_ at the sender side to NVT 7-bit data and delivers it to the client SMTP. The message on the receiver side is transferred back to the original data. As well as we can send video and audio data using MIME as it transfers them also in 7-bit ASCII data.\n\n**Features of MIME \u2013**\n\n1. It is able to send multiple attachments with a single message.\n2. Unlimited message length.\n3. Binary attachments (executables, images, audio, or video files) may be divided if needed.\n4. MIME provided support for varying content types and multi-part messages.\n\n**Working of MIME \u2013**\n\nSuppose a user wants to send an email through a user agent and it is in a non-ASCII format so there is a MIME protocol that converts it into 7-bit NVT ASCII format. The message is transferred through the e-mail system to the other side in the 7-bit format now MIME protocol again converts it back into non-ASCII code and now the user agent of the receiver side reads it and then information is finally read by the receiver. MIME header is basically inserted at the beginning of any e-mail transfer.\n\n**MIME with SMTP and POP \u2013**\n\nSMTP transfers the mail being a message transfer agent from the sender\u2019s side to the mailbox of the receiver side and stores it and MIME header is added to the original header and provides additional information. while POP being the message access agent organizes the mails from the mail server to the receiver\u2019s computer. POP allows the user agent to connect with the message transfer agent.\n\n**MIME Header:**\n\nIt is added to the original e-mail header section to define transformation. There are _five headers_ that we add to the original header:\n\n1. **MIME-Version \u2013** Defines the version of the MIME protocol. It must have the parameter _Value 1.0_, which indicates that message is formatted using MIME.\n2. **Content-Type \u2013** Type of data used in the body of the message. They are of different types like text data (plain, HTML), audio content, or video content.\n3. **Content-Type Encoding \u2013** It defines the method used for encoding the message. Like 7-bit encoding, 8-bit encoding, etc.\n4. **Content Id \u2013** It is used for uniquely identifying the message.\n5. **Content description \u2013** It defines whether the body is actually an image, video, or audio.\n\n**Advantages of MIME:**\n\n- It has the ability to transfer text, audio, and video files, among other sorts of data, in a message.\n- Additionally, it allows for the sending and receiving of emails in a variety of languages, including Hindi, French, Japanese, Chinese, and others.\n- Additionally, it gives users the option to connect HTML and CSS to email, enabling them to customise and beautify email according to their preferences.\n- Regardless of how long an email is, it can convey the information inside.\n- It gives each email a special ID.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- The receiving system\u2019s interpretation of MIME media types may not always be accurate, which might cause issues with how the content is handled or displayed.\n- Because they call for additional headers to be provided along with the information, MIME media types can increase the overhead associated with content transmission. This might lead to larger transferred data files and slower transfer rates.\n- Consumers frequently lack a solid understanding of MIME media types, and the use of several media types can make it even more challenging for consumers to comprehend the content being transferred.\n- Some systems might not always support MIME media types, which might cause issues with the transmission of specific kinds of content.\n\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-message-access-protocol-imap/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-message-access-protocol-imap/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/urh814lo8oh1qyspbl6o)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/niharika123/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[niharika123](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/niharika123/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) Protocol\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nMultipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) is a standard that was proposed by Bell Communications in 1991 in order to expand the limited capabilities of email.

User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user when that user logs in to a computer system.\n\nThere are different types of authentication systems which are: \u2013\n\n1\\. Single-Factor authentication: \u2013 This was the first method of security that was developed. On this authentication system, the user has to enter the username and the password to confirm whether that user is logging in or not. Now if the username or password is wrong, then the user will not be allowed to log in or access the system.\n\nAdvantage of the Single-Factor Authentication System: \u2013\n\n- It is a very simple to use and straightforward system.\n- it is not at all costly.\n- The user does not need any huge technical skills.\n\nThe disadvantage of the Single-Factor Authentication\n\n- It is not at all password secure. It will depend on the strength of the password entered by the user.\n- The protection level in Single-Factor Authentication is much low.\n\n2\\. Two-factor Authentication: \u2013 In this authentication system, the user has to give a username, password, and other information. There are various types of authentication systems that are used by the user for securing the system. Some of them are: \u2013 wireless tokens and virtual tokens. OTP and more.\n\nAdvantages of the Two-Factor Authentication\n\n- The Two-Factor Authentication System provides better security than the Single-factor Authentication system.\n- The productivity and flexibility increase in the two-factor authentication system.\n- Two-Factor Authentication prevents the loss of trust.\n\nDisadvantages of Two-Factor Authentication\n\n- It is time-consuming.\n\n3\\. Multi-Factor authentication system,: \u2013 In this type of authentication, more than one factor of authentication is needed. This gives better security to the user. Any type of keylogger or phishing attack will not be possible in a Multi-Factor Authentication system. This assures the user, that the information will not get stolen from them.\n\nThe advantage of the Multi-Factor Authentication System are: \u2013\n\n- No risk of security.\n- No information could get stolen.\n- No risk of any key-logger activity.\n- No risk of any data getting captured.\n\nThe disadvantage of the Multi-Factor Authentication System are: \u2013\n\n- It is time-consuming.\n- it can rely on third parties. The main objective of authentication is to allow authorized users to access the computer and to deny access to unauthorized users. Operating Systems generally identify/authenticates users using the following 3 ways: Passwords, Physical identification, and Biometrics. These are explained as following below.\n01. **Passwords:** Password verification is the most popular and commonly used authentication technique. A password is a secret text that is supposed to be known only to a user. In a password-based system, each user is assigned a valid username and password by the system administrator. The system stores all usernames and Passwords. When a user logs in, their user name and password are verified by comparing them with the stored login name and password. If the contents are the same then the user is allowed to access the system otherwise it is rejected.\n02. **Physical Identification:** This technique includes machine-readable badges(symbols), cards, or smart cards. In some companies, badges are required for employees to gain access to the organization\u2019s gate. In many systems, identification is combined with the use of a password i.e the user must insert the card and then supply his /her password. This kind of authentication is commonly used with ATMs. Smart cards can enhance this scheme by keeping the user password within the card itself. This allows authentication without the storage of passwords in the computer system. The loss of such a card can be dangerous.\n03. **Biometrics:** This method of authentication is based on the unique biological characteristics of each user such as fingerprints, voice or face recognition, signatures, and eyes.\n04. A scanner or other devices to gather the necessary data about the user.\n05. Software to convert the data into a form that can be compared and stored.\n06. A database that stores information for all authorized users.\n07. **Facial Characteristics \u2013** Humans are differentiated on the basis of facial characteristics such as eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and chin shape.\n08. **Fingerprints \u2013** Fingerprints are believed to be unique across the entire human population.\n09. **Hand Geometry \u2013** Hand geometry systems identify features of the hand that includes the shape, length, and width of fingers.\n10. **Retinal pattern \u2013** It is concerned with the detailed structure of the eye.\n11. **Signature \u2013** Every individual has a unique style of handwriting, and this feature is reflected in the signatures of a person.\n12. **Voice \u2013** This method records the frequency pattern of the voice of an individual speaker.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-online-privacy-and-how-is-it-affected/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Online Privacy and how is it affected?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-online-privacy-and-how-is-it-affected/?ref=next_article)\n\n[H](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/harleenk_99/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[harleenk\\_99](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/harleenk_99/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Cyber-security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cyber-security/?ref=article_tag)\n- [Information-Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/information-security/?ref=article_tag)\n- [Network-security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/network-security/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Fundamental Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis Computer Fundamental Tutorial covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, including computer hardware, software, operating systems, peripherals, etc. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, this tutorial is designed to enhance your computer skills and take them to the n\\\\\n\\\\\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-fundamentals-tutorial/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Introduction To Computer Fundamentals\n\n- [What is Computer?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA computer is an electronic device that can process and store information.

It secures sensitive data by rendering it unreadable to unauthorized events, making sure of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.\n\n## What is Encryption?\n\n**Encryption** in cryptography is a process by which plain text or a piece of information is converted into cipher text or text that can only be decoded by the receiver for whom the information was intended. The algorithm used for the encryption process is known as cipher. It helps to protect consumer information, emails, and other sensitive data from unauthorized access as well as secures communication networks. Presently there are many options to choose from and find the most secure algorithm that meets our requirements.\n\n### Types of Encryption\n\nThere are two methods or types through which encryption take place, these below are two types of encryption:\n\n- [Symmetric Key Encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-symmetric-encryption/)\n- [Asymmetric Key Encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-asymmetric-encryption/)\n\n## Features of Encryption\n\n- **Confidentiality:**\u00a0Information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no other person except him can access it.\n- **Integrity:**\u00a0Information cannot be modified in storage or transition between sender and intended receiver without any addition to information being detected.\n- **Non-repudiation:**\u00a0The creator/sender of information cannot deny his intention to send information at later stage.\n- **Authentication:**\u00a0The identities of sender and receiver are confirmed. As well as you can detect the origination of information is confirmed.\n\n## Encryption Algorithms\n\nTo secure information, you can employ a variety of data encryption algorithms. The algorithms differ in terms of how accurately they safeguard data as well as how complex they are. Some of the more popular algorithms that have been in use over the years are listed below:\n\n### **1\\. AES**( **Advance Encryption Standard**)\n\n[Advance Encryption Standard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advanced-encryption-standard-aes/) also abbreviated as AES, is a symmetric block cipher which is chosen by United States government to protect significant information and is used to encrypt sensitive data of hardware and software. AES has three 128-bit fixed block ciphers of keys having sizes 128, 192 and 256 bits. Key sizes are unlimited but block size is maximum 256 bits.The AES design is based on a substitution-permutation network (SPN) and does not use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) Feistel network.\n\n### **2\\. RSA (** **Rivest, Shamir and Adleman)**\n\nRSA is an asymmetric key algorithm which is named after its creators [Rivest, Shamir and Adleman](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/). The algorithm is based on the fact that the factors of large composite number is difficult: when the integers are prime, this method is known as Prime Factorization. It is generator of public key and private key. Using public key we convert plain text to cipher text and private key is used for converting cipher text to plain text. Public key is accessible by everyone whereas Private Key is kept secret. Public Key and Private Key are kept different.Thus making it more secure algorithm for data security.\n\n### **3\\. Triple DES**\n\nTriple DES is a block cipher algorithm that was created to replace its older version [Data Encryption Standard(DES)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-encryption-standard-des-set-1/). In 1956 it was found out that 56 key-bit of DES was not enough to prevent brute force attack, so Triple DES was discovered with the purpose of enlarging the key space without any requirement to change algorithm. It has a key length of 168 bits three 56-bit DES keys but due to meet-in-middle-attack the effective security is only provided for only 112 bits. However Triple DES suffers from slow performance in software. Triple DES is well suited for hardware implementation. But presently Triple DES is largely replaced by AES (Advance Encryption Standard).\n\n### **4\\. Twofish**\n\n[Twofish algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-aes-and-twofish/) is successor of blowfish algorithm. It was designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kesley, Dough Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall and Niels Ferguson. It uses block ciphering It uses a single key of length 256 bits and is said to be efficient both for software that runs in smaller processors such as those in smart cards and for embedding in hardware .It allows implementers to trade off encryption speed, key setup time, and code size to balance performance.\n\n### 5\\. Blowfish\n\n[Blowfish](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blowfish-algorithm-with-examples/) was created to solve the DES algorithm\u2019s problem. The algorithm is freely usable by everyone and has been released into the public domain. The technique uses a 64-bit block size, and the length of the key can range from 32 to 448 bits. It is the best permutation technique for cipher-related encryption and operates on the Feistel structure using a 16-bit round cipher. The information in the Blowfish algorithm is encrypted and decrypted using a single key.\n\n## Advantages of Encryption\n\n- Data encryption keeps the data isolated from the security of the device on which it is stored.\n- Encryption improves the security of our information.\n- When the data is encrypted, it can only decrypt by the person having key.\n\n## Disadvantages of Encryption\n\n- If the password or key is lost, the user will be unable to open the encrypted file.\n- Although data encryption is a useful data security strategy, it requires a lot of resources, including time, data processing, and the use of many encryption and decryption techniques.\n\n## **Future of Encryption**\n\nWith advancement in technology it becomes more easier to encrypt data, with neural networks it becomes easier to keep data safe. Neural Networks of Google Brain have worked out to create encryption, without teaching specifics of encryption algorithm. Data Scientist and Cryptographers are finding out ways to prevent brute force attack on encryption algorithms to avoid any unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nData protection is a function of encryption, and algorithm refers to a set of guidelines or remarks that must be followed to throughout the encryption process. The encryption functions, procedures, and keys utilised all contribute to the system\u2019s effectiveness. Using a public or private key, the recipient may transform the coded text or unreadable format back to plain text.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Encryption\n\n### Which encryption method is more secure?\n\n> Most people believe that AES is resistant to all types of attacks except brute force attacks. Still, a lot of internet security experts think that AES will become the industry standard for private-sector\u00a0data encryption in the future.\n\n### Why is encryption needed?\n\n> Encryption helps to protect private data, sensitive information, and can improve the security of communication between client and servers.\n\n### Which encryption is fastest?\n\n> Symmetric encryption is much faster then asymmetric encryption.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-1-hash-in-java/?ref=next_article)\n\n[SHA-1 Hash](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-1-hash-in-java/?ref=next_article)\n\n[J](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/JASHKOTHARI1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[JASHKOTHARI1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/JASHKOTHARI1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n11\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [cryptography](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cryptography/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Cryptography Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCryptography is a technique of securing communication by converting plain text into unintelligible ciphertext.

It acts like a security guard that helps keep your digital world safe from unwanted visitors and potential threats.\n\n- **Accept:** allow the traffic\n- **Reject:** block the traffic but reply with an \u201cunreachable error\u201d\n- **Drop:** block the traffic with no reply\n\nA firewall is a type of network security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic with security policies that have previously been set up inside an organization. A firewall is essentially the wall that separates a private internal network from the open Internet at its very basic level.\n\n![Firewall](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/introduction-to-firewall-1.png)\n\n## **Need For Firewall**\n\nBefore Firewalls, network security was performed by [Access Control Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-lists-acl/) (ACLs) residing on routers. ACLs are rules that determine whether network access should be granted or denied to specific IP address. But ACLs cannot determine the nature of the packet it is blocking. Also, ACL alone does not have the capacity to keep threats out of the network. Hence, the Firewall was introduced. Connectivity to the Internet is no longer optional for organizations. However, accessing the Internet provides benefits to the organization; it also enables the outside world to interact with the internal network of the organization. This creates a threat to the organization. In order to secure the internal network from unauthorized traffic, we need a Firewall.\n\n## History of Firewalls\n\n- **Late 1980s**: Jeff Mogul, Brian Reid, and Paul Vixie at Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) developed packet-filtering technology, laying the groundwork for firewalls by checking external connections before they reached internal networks.\n- **Late 1980s \u2013 Early 1990s**: AT&T Bell Labs researchers, including Presotto, Sharma, and Nigam, developed the **circuit-level gateway**, a firewall that vetted ongoing connections without reauthorizing each data packet, paving the way for more efficient security.\n- **1991-1992**: Marcus Ranum introduced security proxies at DEC, leading to the creation of the **Secure External Access Link (SEAL)**, the first commercially available application-layer firewall, based on earlier DEC work.\n- **1993-1994**: At **Check Point**, Gil Shwed pioneered **stateful inspection technology**, filing a patent in 1993. Nir Zuk developed a graphical interface for **Firewall-1**, making firewalls accessible and widely adopted by businesses and homes\n\n## **Working of Firewall**\n\n- Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table. Once the rule is matched, associate action is applied to the network traffic. For example, Rules are defined as any employee from Human Resources department cannot access the data from code server and at the same time another rule is defined like system administrator can access the data from both Human Resource and technical department.\n- Rules can be defined on the firewall based on the necessity and security policies of the organization.\n- From the perspective of a server, network traffic can be either outgoing or incoming. Firewall maintains a distinct set of rules for both the cases. Mostly the outgoing traffic, originated from the server itself, allowed to pass. Still, setting a rule on outgoing traffic is always better in order to achieve more security and prevent unwanted communication. Incoming traffic is treated differently.\n- Most traffic which reaches on the firewall is one of these three major Transport Layer protocols- TCP, [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) or [ICMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/). All these types have a source address and destination address. Also, TCP and UDP have port numbers. ICMP uses _type code_ instead of port number which identifies purpose of that packet.\n\n**Default policy:** It is very difficult to explicitly cover every possible rule on the firewall. For this reason, the firewall must always have a default policy. Default policy only consists of action (accept, reject or drop). Suppose no rule is defined about SSH connection to the server on the firewall. So, it will follow the default policy. If default policy on the firewall is set to _accept_, then any computer outside of your office can establish an SSH connection to the server. Therefore, setting default policy as _drop_(or reject) is always a good practice.\n\n## **Types of Firewall**\n\nFirewalls can be categorized based on their generation.\n\n![Firewall](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203141755719319/Firewall.webp)\n\n### **1\\. Packet Filtering Firewall**\n\nPacket filtering firewall is used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or stop based on source and destination IP address, protocols, and ports. It analyses traffic at the transport protocol layer (but mainly uses first 3 layers). Packet firewalls treat each packet in isolation. They have no ability to tell whether a packet is part of an existing stream of traffic. Only It can allow or deny the packets based on unique packet headers. Packet filtering firewall maintains a filtering table that decides whether the packet will be forwarded or discarded. From the given filtering table, the packets will be filtered according to the following rules:\n\n![Packet Filter Firewall](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/introducton-to-firewall-2.png)\n\n- Incoming packets from network 192.168.21.0 are blocked.\n- Incoming packets destined for the internal TELNET server (port 23) are blocked.\n- Incoming packets destined for host 192.168.21.3 are blocked.\n- All well-known services to the network 192.168.21.0 are allowed.\n\n### **2\\. Stateful Inspection Firewall**\n\nStateful firewalls (performs Stateful Packet Inspection) are able to determine the connection state of packet, unlike Packet filtering firewall, which makes it more efficient. It keeps track of the state of networks connection travelling across it, such as TCP streams. So the filtering decisions would not only be based on defined rules, but also on packet\u2019s history in the state table.\n\n![Stateful-Inspection-Firewall](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203143041158469/Stateful-Inspection-Firewall.webp)\n\n### **3\\. Application Layer Firewall**\n\nApplication layer firewall can inspect and filter the packets on any OSI layer, up to the application layer. It has the ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocols (like [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/), [FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-transfer-protocol-ftp-in-application-layer/)) are being misused. In other words, Application layer firewalls are hosts that run proxy servers. A proxy firewall prevents the direct connection between either side of the firewall, each packet has to pass through the proxy.\n\n### **4\\. Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**\n\nNGFW consists of Deep Packet Inspection, Application Inspection, [SSL/SSH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ssh-and-ssl/) inspection and many functionalities to protect the network from these modern threats.\n\n![Next-generation-Firewalls](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203143204376587/Next-generation-Firewalls.webp)\n\n### 5\\. **Circuit Level Gateway Firewall**\n\nThis works as the Sessions layer of the [OSI Model\u2019s](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/) . This allows for the simultaneous setup of two [Transmission Control Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) (TCP) connections. It can effortlessly allow data packets to flow without using quite a lot of computing power. These firewalls are ineffective because they do not inspect data packets; if malware is found in a data packet, they will permit it to pass provided that TCP connections are established properly.\n\n### 6\\. **Software Firewall**\n\nA software firewall is any firewall that is set up locally or on a cloud server. When it comes to controlling the inflow and outflow of data packets and limiting the number of networks that can be linked to a single device, they may be the most advantageous. But the problem with software firewall is they are time-consuming.\n\n![Software-firewalls](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203142344179556/Software-firewalls.webp)\n\n### 7\\. **Hardware Firewall**\n\nThey also go by the name \u201cfirewalls based on physical appliances.\u201d It guarantees that the malicious data is halted before it reaches the network endpoint that is in danger.\n\n![Hardware-Firewall](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250203143113553852/Hardware-Firewall.webp)\n\n### **8\\. Cloud Firewall**\n\nThese are software-based, cloud-deployed network devices. This cloud-based firewall protects a private network from any unwanted access. Unlike traditional firewalls, a cloud firewall filters data at the cloud level.\n\n## Importance of Firewalls\n\nSo, what does a firewall do and why is it important? Without protection, networks are vulnerable to any traffic trying to access your systems, whether it\u2019s harmful or not. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to check all network traffic.\n\nWhen you connect personal computers to other IT systems or the internet, it opens up many benefits like collaboration, resource sharing, and creativity. But it also exposes your network and devices to risks like hacking, identity theft, malware, and online fraud.\n\nOnce a malicious person finds your network, they can easily access and threaten it, especially with constant internet connections.\n\nUsing a firewall is essential for proactive protection against these risks. It helps users shield their networks from the worst dangers.\n\n## What Does Firewall Security Do?\n\nA firewall serves as a security barrier for a network, narrowing the attack surface to a single point of contact. Instead of every device on a network being exposed to the internet, all traffic must first go through the firewall. This way, the firewall can filter and block non-permitted traffic, whether it\u2019s coming in or going out. Additionally, firewalls help create a record of attempted connections, improving security awareness.\n\n### What Can Firewalls Protect Against?\n\n- **Infiltration by Malicious Actors:** Firewalls can block suspicious connections, preventing eavesdropping and advanced persistent threats (APTs).\n- **Parental Controls:** Parents can use firewalls to block their children from accessing explicit web content.\n- **Workplace Web Browsing Restrictions:** Employers can restrict employees from using the company network to access certain services and websites, like social media.\n- **Nationally Controlled Intranet:** Governments can block access to certain web content and services that conflict with national policies or values.\n\nBy allowing network owners to set specific rules, firewalls offer customizable protection for various scenarios, enhancing overall network security.\n\n## Advantages of Using Firewall\n\n- **Protection From Unauthorized Access:**\u00a0Firewalls can be set up to restrict incoming traffic from particular [IP addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) or networks, preventing hackers or other malicious actors from easily accessing a network or system. Protection from unwanted access.\n- **Prevention of Malware and Other Threats:** [Malware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/malware-and-its-types/) and other threat prevention: Firewalls can be set up to block traffic linked to known malware or other security concerns, assisting in the defense against these kinds of attacks.\n- **Control of Network Access:** By limiting access to specified individuals or groups for particular servers or applications, firewalls can be used to restrict access to particular network resources or services.\n- **Monitoring of Network Activity:**\u00a0Firewalls can be set up to record and keep track of all network activity.\n- **Regulation Compliance:** Many industries are bound by rules that demand the usage of firewalls or other security measures.\n- **Network Segmentation:**\u00a0By using firewalls to split up a bigger network into smaller subnets, the attack surface is reduced and the security level is raised.\n\n## Disadvantages of Using Firewall\n\n- **Complexity:** Setting up and keeping up a firewall can be time-consuming and difficult, especially for bigger networks or companies with a wide variety of users and devices.\n- **Limited Visibility:** Firewalls may not be able to identify or stop security risks that operate at other levels, such as the application or endpoint level, because they can only observe and manage traffic at the network level.\n- **False Sense of Security:**\u00a0Some businesses may place an excessive amount of reliance on their firewall and disregard other crucial security measures like endpoint security or intrusion detection systems.\n- **Limited adaptability:**\u00a0Because firewalls are frequently rule-based, they might not be able to respond to fresh security threats.\n- **Performance Impact:**\u00a0Network performance can be significantly impacted by firewalls, particularly if they are set up to analyze or manage a lot of traffic.\n- **Limited Scalability:**\u00a0Because firewalls are only able to secure one network, businesses that have several networks must deploy many firewalls, which can be expensive.\n- **Limited VPN support:** Some firewalls might not allow complex [VPN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vpn-and-how-it-works/) features like split tunneling, which could restrict the experience of a remote worker.\n- **Cost:** Purchasing many devices or add-on features for a firewall system can be expensive, especially for businesses.\n\n### **Question: A packet filtering firewall can \\[ISRO CS 2013\\]**\n\n(A) Deny certain users from accessing a service\n\n(B) Block worms and viruses from entering the network\n\n(C) Disallow some files from being accessed through FTP\n\n(D) Block some hosts from accessing the network\n\nAnswer: Option

\u2013 FAQs\n\n### Can Network Speeds Be Slowed Down by a Firewall?\n\n> Yes, Network speeds can be slowed down by a firewall.\n\n### How do firewall stop traffic?\n\n> The firewall acts as a constant filter, analyzing incoming data and blocking anything that appears suspicious from entering your network to protect system.\n\n### Can Firewalls Stop Worms?\n\n> Yes, Installing a firewall helps prevent worms and malicious software from infecting a computer in addition to blocking unwanted traffic.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with

A wired adapter allows us to set up a connection to a modem or router via Ethernet in a computer whereas a wireless adapter identifies and connects to remote hot spots. Each adapter has a distinct label known as a MAC address which recognizes and authenticates the computer. Mac address is shown in the format of 00:00:00:00:00:00 or 00-00-00-00-00-00.\n\n**About and working:**\n\nMAC filtering is a security method based on access control. In this, each address is assigned a 48-bit address which is used to determine whether we can access a network or not. It helps in listing a set of allowed devices that you need on your Wi-Fi and the list of denied devices that you don\u2019t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. In a way, we can deny list or allow a list of certain computers based on their MAC address. We can configure the filter to allow connection only to those devices included in the white list. White lists provide greater security than denied lists because the router grants access only to selected devices.\n\nIt is used on enterprise wireless networks having multiple access points to prevent clients from communicating with each other. The access point can be configured to only allow clients to talk to the default gateway, but not other wireless clients. It increases the efficiency of access to a network\n\nThe router allows configuring a list of allowed MAC addresses in its web interface, allowing you to choose which devices can connect to your network. The router has a number of functions designed to improve the security of the network but not all are useful. Media access control may seem advantageous but there are certain flaws.\n\nOn a wireless network, the device with the proper credentials such as SSID and password can authenticate with the router and join the network which gets an IP address and access to the internet and any shared resources.\n\nMAC address filtering adds an extra layer of security that checks the device\u2019s MAC address against a list of agreed addresses. If the client\u2019s address matches one on the router\u2019s list, access is granted otherwise it doesn\u2019t join the network.\n\n**Steps for Mac filtering \u2013**\n\n1. Set a list of allowed devices. Only those MAC addresses which are on the list will be provided services by the DHCP.\n2. Set a list of denied devices. The MAC addresses which are on the denied list will not be granted server by DHCP.\n3. If the MAC address is on both the allowed and denied list then it will be denied the service.\n\nFor enabling a list of allowed, denied or both devices follow the steps given below.\n\n1. Go to the DHCP console, right-click the IPv4 node, and click properties.\n2. Use the current filter configuration details on the filter tab and use an allow list by selecting enable allow list and use a denied list by selecting enable deny list.\n3. Click OK and save changes.\n\n**Updating Mac filtering:**\n\nNote that if MAC Filtering is enabled on a wireless router and the MAC address is not entered then the wireless device connected to the router will not be able to connect\n\nWe do not need to enable MAC Filtering if this is already disabled for troubleshooting purposes. Router manufacturers are more knowledgeable in this field.\n\n**What to Do \u2013**\n\n1. Go to your router settings.\n\nIn the router\u2019s settings locate the tab or setting \u201cMAC Filtering.\u201d This is found within a router\u2019s \u201cWireless\u201d or \u201cWireless Security\u201d options. In some routers, MAC Filtering may also be referred to as \u201cMAC Address Control, \u201c\u201d Address Reservation, \u201d or \u201cWireless MAC Authentication.\u201d\n2. One needs to add the Nintendo system\u2019s MAC Address to the list of allowed devices and save or apply this change if MAC Filtering is on or enabled. If you do not want MAC Filtering on for your network turn it off or disable it.\n\n> **Note \u2013** You can enable the MAC filter on a Linksys Wireless-N router through the Wireless > Wireless MAC Filter page. We can do this on NETGEAR routers through ADVANCED > Security > Access Control and on D-Link routers through ADVANCED > NETWORK FILTER.S\n\n### applications of MAC filtering in computer networks:\n\n01. **Access control:** MAC filtering can be used to restrict access to a network by only allowing devices with authorized MAC addresses to connect. This can help prevent unauthorized access to the network and improve network security.\n02. **Parental controls:** MAC filtering can be used by parents to restrict access to the internet for their children by allowing only specific devices to connect to the network.\n03. **BYOD policies:** MAC filtering can be used to implement Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies in organizations. By allowing only authorized devices to connect to the network, organizations can ensure that only approved devices are used to access corporate resources.\n04. **Guest access:** MAC filtering can be used to provide guest access to a network by allowing only specific devices to connect. This can help improve security and prevent unauthorized access to the network.\n05. **Wireless networks:** MAC filtering can be used to secure wireless networks by allowing only authorized devices to connect to the network. This can help prevent unauthorized access to the network and protect sensitive data.\n06. **Network monitoring:** MAC filtering can be used to monitor network traffic by allowing only specific devices to connect and tracking their activity on the network.\n07. **Compliance:** MAC filtering can be used to enforce compliance with security policies and regulations by ensuring that only authorized devices are allowed to connect to the network.\n08. **Traffic management:** MAC filtering can be used to manage network traffic by limiting the number of devices that are allowed to connect to the network at any given time.\n09. **Troubleshooting:** MAC filtering can be used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues by identifying unauthorized devices that may be causing problems on the network.\n10. **Remote management:** MAC filtering can be used to provide remote management capabilities for network devices by allowing only specific devices to connect to the network and access network resources.\n11. **IoT device security:** MAC filtering can be used to secure Internet of Things (IoT) devices by allowing only authorized devices to connect to the network and access IoT resources.\n\n\n**Drawbacks:**\n\n- It is time-consuming and tedious especially if you have a lot of Wi-Fi-enabled devices as you will need to get the MAC to address every device. The list of allowed devices should be modified whenever we want to purchase a new computer or mobile device or whenever we want to grant permission to a new device.\n- Two MAC addresses should be added for the PCs one being the wired adapter and one being the wireless adapter.\n- It won\u2019t protect against hackers who know what they are doing. But you can use it for kids to disallow access as they don\u2019t have adequate knowledge.\n- It can make the network less secure because now the hacker doesn\u2019t have to crack your WPA2-encrypted password at all.\n- **Limited effectiveness:** MAC filtering is not foolproof and can be easily bypassed by experienced hackers who can spoof or change their MAC addresses. Additionally, some devices may allow users to change their MAC addresses, making it difficult to control network access.\n- **Compatibility issues:** Some devices may not be compatible with MAC filtering or may have issues connecting to the network if their MAC address is not properly configured. This can cause connectivity issues and may require additional troubleshooting.\n- **Increased network management complexity:** Maintaining a list of authorized MAC addresses can be time-consuming and difficult to manage, especially for larger networks with many devices. Additionally, it can be challenging to identify and remove unauthorized devices from the network.\n- **False sense of security:** Relying solely on MAC filtering can give a false sense of security as it is just one layer of network security. It is important to also use other security measures such as encryption, strong passwords, and firewalls to protect the network from threats.\n\n**Security \u2013**\n\nBy examining the packet using Wireshark hackers with a toolset like Kali Linux can access the network as they can get the MAC address of allowed devices and then they can change their device\u2019s MAC address to the allowed MAC address and connect posing as that device. They can use \u201cdeauth\u201dor \u201cdeassoc\u201d attack that forcefully disconnects a device from a Wi-Fi network or use airplay-ng to send disassociation packets to the clients and then connect in the device\u2019s place. However, MAC addresses of wireless clients can\u2019t truly be changed because they\u2019re encoded in the hardware. But some critics spotted that MAC addresses can be faked. All an attacker needs to do is to know one of the valid addresses. They don\u2019t have to break the encryption to access your network or crack your WPA2 encrypted password. They just have to pretend to be a trusted computer.\n\nMAC filtering will prevent average hackers from gaining network access. Most computer users don\u2019t know how to trick their MAC address let alone find a router\u2019s list of approved addresses. Unlike domain filter, they do not stop traffic from flowing through the network.\n\nA general doubt that arises is how the hackers can get our MAC address if they can\u2019t connect to the network. It is a weakness of Wi-Fi that even if there is a WPA2 encrypted network, the MAC addresses on those packets are not encrypted. This means that anyone with network sniffing software installed and a wireless card in a range of your network can easily grab all the MAC addresses that are communicating with your router.\n\n**Other solutions to the problem \u2013**\n\n- A better solution to control outsiders who want to connect to your network is to use a guest Wi-Fi network. It will allow them to let others connect to your network, but not let them see anything on your home network. You can purchase a cheap router and attach it to your network with a separate password and separate IP address range to do this.\n- WPA2 encryption is sufficient as it is very difficult to crack. But the key is to have a strong and long password. If someone cracks your WPA2 encryption they don\u2019t have to make the effort to trick MAC filtering. If an attacker is confused by MAC address filtering they won\u2019t be able to break your encryption.\n\n**Does MAC Address Separate Further develop Organization Security?**\n\nHypothetically, the probability of halting pernicious organization action increments when a switch really looks at this association prior to conceding gadgets. Yet, by dissecting the parcel utilizing Wireshark, programmers utilizing a toolset, for example, Kali Linux can get to the organization since they can get the Macintosh locations of supported gadgets, then, at that point, the aggressor can change its gadget\u2019s Macintosh address to the permitted Macintosh address and interface by taking on the appearance of that gadget. They can utilize the \u201cdeauth\u201d or \u201cdeassoc\u201d assaults, which powerfully segregate a gadget from a Wi-Fi organization, or they can use airplay-ng, which sends disassociation bundles to clients and afterward interfaces in the gadget\u2019s place.\n\nThen again, the Macintosh locations of remote clients can\u2019t be changed on the grounds that they are encoded in the equipment. Notwithstanding, a few pundits have brought up that Macintosh locations can be manufactured. An aggressor just needs to know one of the real locations. They don\u2019t have to break the encryption or break your WPA2 scrambled secret phrase to get sufficiently close to your organization. The assailants need to act like a confided in PC.\n\nA typical inquiry emerges to you that how these programmers got our Macintosh address assuming that they couldn\u2019t interface with the organization. Regardless of whether there is a WPA2 scrambled network, the Macintosh tends to on those bundles are not encoded. This implies that anybody having network sniffing programming and a remote card close enough to your organization can undoubtedly catch all of the Macintosh tends to converse with your switch.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-full-form-in-computer-networking/?ref=next_article)\n\n[MAN Full Form in Computer Networking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/man-full-form-in-computer-networking/?ref=next_article)\n\n[V](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/VrindaBajaj/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[VrindaBajaj](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/VrindaBajaj/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n10\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[MAC Filtering in Computer Network\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThere are two kinds of network Adapters.

Multimedia applications, such as video conferencing, streaming services, and VoIP (Voice over IP), require certain bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss parameters. QoS methods help ensure that these requirements are satisfied, allowing for seamless and reliable communication.\n\n## What is Quality of Service?\n\n**Quality-of-service (QoS)** refers to traffic control mechanisms that seek to differentiate performance based on application or network-operator requirements or provide predictable or guaranteed performance to applications, sessions, or traffic aggregates. The basic phenomenon for QoS is in terms of packet delay and losses of various kinds.\n\n## **QoS Specification**\n\n- Delay\n- Delay Variation( [Jitter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-latency-and-jitter-in-os/))\n- Throughput\n- Error Rate\n\n## Types of Quality of Service\n\n- **Stateless Solutions \u2013** [Routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) maintain no fine-grained state about traffic, one positive factor of it is that it is scalable and robust. But it has weak services as there is no guarantee about the kind of delay or performance in a particular application which we have to encounter.\n- **Stateful Solutions \u2013** Routers maintain a per-flow state as flow is very important in providing the Quality-of-Service i.e. providing powerful services such as guaranteed services and high resource utilization, providing protection, and is much less scalable and robust.\n\n## QoS Parameters\n\n- **Packet loss:** This occurs when network connections get congested, and routers and [switches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-switches-in-computer-network/) begin losing packets.\n- **Jitter:** This is the result of network congestion, time drift, and routing changes. Too much jitter can reduce the quality of voice and video communication.\n- **Latency:** This is how long it takes a packet to travel from its source to its destination. The latency should be as near to zero as possible.\n- **Bandwidth:** This is a network communications link\u2019s ability to transmit the majority of data from one place to another in a specific amount of time.\n- **Mean opinion score:** This is a metric for rating voice quality that uses a five-point scale, with five representing the highest quality.\n\n## How does QoS Work?\n\n**Quality of Service (QoS)** ensures the performance of critical applications within limited network capacity.\n\n- **Packet Marking**: QoS marks packets to identify their service types. For example, it distinguishes between voice, video, and data traffic.\n- **Virtual Queues**: Routers create separate virtual queues for each application based on priority. Critical apps get reserved bandwidth.\n- **Handling Allocation**: QoS assigns the order in which packets are processed, ensuring appropriate [bandwidth](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bandwidth-definition-working-importance-uses/) for each application\n\n## Benefits of QoS\n\n- Improved Performance for Critical Applications\n- Enhanced User Experience\n- Efficient Bandwidth Utilization\n- Increased Network Reliability\n- Compliance with [Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/service-level-agreements-in-cloud-computing/)\n- Reduced Network Costs\n- Improved Security\n- Better Scalability\n\n## Why is QoS Important?\n\n- Video and audio conferencing require abounded delay and loss rate.\n- Video and audio streaming requires a bounded packet loss rate, it may not be so sensitive to delay.\n- Time-critical applications (real-time control) in which bounded delay is considered to be an important factor.\n- Valuable applications should provide better services than less valuable applications.\n\n## Implementing QoS\n\n- **Planning:** The organization should develop an awareness of each department\u2019s service needs and requirements, select an appropriate model, and build stakeholder support.\n- **Design:** The organization should then keep track of all key software and hardware changes and modify the chosen QoS model to the characteristics of its network infrastructure.\n- **Testing:** The organization should test QoS settings and policies in a secure, controlled testing environment where faults can be identified.\n- **Deployment:** Policies should be implemented in phases. An organization can choose to deploy rules by network segment or by QoS function (what each policy performs).\n- **Monitoring and analyzing:** Policies should be modified to increase performance based on performance data.\n\n## Models to Implement QoS\n\n### **1\\. Integrated Services(IntServ)**\n\n- An architecture for providing QoS guarantees in [IP networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) for individual application sessions.\n- Relies on resource reservation, and routers need to maintain state information of allocated resources and respond to new call setup requests.\n- Network decides whether to admit or deny a new call setup request.\n\n### **2\\. IntServ QoS Components**\n\n- Resource reservation: call setup signaling, traffic, QoS declaration, per-element admission control.\n- QoS-sensitive scheduling e.g WFQ queue discipline.\n- QoS-sensitive routing algorithm(QSPF)\n- QoS-sensitive packet discard strategy.\n\n### **3\\. RSVP-Internet Signaling**\n\nIt creates and maintains distributed reservation state, initiated by the receiver and scales for multicast, which needs to be refreshed otherwise reservation times out as it is in soft state. Latest paths were discovered through \u201cPATH\u201d messages (forward direction) and used by RESV messages (reserve direction).\n\n### **4\\. Call Admission**\n\n- Session must first declare it\u2019s QoS requirement and characterize the traffic it will send through the network.\n- **R-specification:** defines the QoS being requested, i.e. what kind of bound we want on the delay, what kind of packet loss is acceptable, etc.\n- **T-specification:** defines the traffic characteristics like bustiness in the traffic.\n- A signaling protocol is needed to carry the R-spec and T-spec to the routers where reservation is required.\n- Routers will admit calls based on their R-spec, T-spec and based on the current resource allocated at the routers to other calls.\n\n### **5\\. Diff-Serv**\n\nDifferentiated Service is a stateful solution in which each flow doesn\u2019t mean a different state. It provides reduced state services i.e. maintaining state only for larger granular flows rather than end-to-end flows tries to achieve the best of both worlds. Intended to address the following difficulties with IntServ and RSVP:\n\n- **Flexible Service Models:** IntServ has only two classes, want to provide more qualitative service classes: want to provide \u2018relative\u2019 service distinction.\n- **Simpler signaling:** Many applications and users may only want to specify a more qualitative notion of service.\n\n## QoS Tools\n\n- Traffic Classification and Marking\n- Traffic Shaping and Policing\n- Queue Management and Scheduling\n- Resource Reservation\n- Congestion Management\n\n## What is Multimedia?\n\nThe word\u00a0**multi**\u00a0and\u00a0**media**\u00a0are combined to form the word\u00a0[**multimedia**.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-multimedia/) The word \u201c **multi\u201d signifies \u201cmany**.\u201d\u00a0**Multimedia is a type of medium that allows information to be easily transferred from one location to another**. Multimedia is the presentation of\u00a0**text**,\u00a0**pictures**,\u00a0**audio**, and\u00a0**video**\u00a0with links and tools that allow the user to navigate, engage, create, and communicate using a computer.\n\n## **Components of Multimedia**\n\n- **Text**: Characters are used to form words, phrases, and paragraphs in the text. The text can be in a variety of fonts and sizes to match the multimedia software\u2019s professional presentation.\n- **Graphics**: Non-text information, such as a sketch, chart, or photograph, is represented digitally. Graphics add to the appeal of the multimedia application. The use of visuals in multimedia enhances the effectiveness and presentation of the concept. Windows Picture, Internet Explorer, and other similar programs are often used to see visuals.\n- **Animations**: Animation is the process of making a still image appear to move. A presentation can also be made lighter and more appealing by using animation. In multimedia applications, the animation is quite popular. The following are some of the most regularly used animation viewing programs: Fax Viewer, Internet Explorer, etc.\n- **Video**: Photographic images that appear to be in full motion and are played back at speeds of 15 to 30 frames per second. The term video refers to a moving image that is accompanied by sound, such as a television picture.\n- **Audio**: Any sound, whether it\u2019s music, conversation, or something else. Sound is the most serious aspect of multimedia, delivering the joy of music, special effects, and other forms of entertainment. Decibels are a unit of measurement for volume and sound pressure level. Audio files are used as part of the application context as well as to enhance interaction. Audio files must occasionally be distributed using plug-in media players when they appear within online applications and webpages. MP3, WMA, Wave, MIDI, and RealAudio are examples of audio formats. The following programs are widely used to view videos: Real Player, Window Media Player, etc.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nQoS is critical for ensuring that multimedia applications run smoothly and effectively across a network. QoS techniques contribute to the quality and reliability of real-time applications by regulating bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss. To fulfill the distinct requirements of various forms of network traffic, QoS is implemented using a combination of categorization, prioritization, resource reservation, and traffic management techniques.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on QoS and Multimedia \u2013 FAQs\n\n### How can we ensure QoS in the computer network?\n\n> QoS works by identifying service types in packets and configuring routers to generate separate virtual queues for each application based on priority.\n\n### Does QoS help in WIFI?\n\n> Yes it helps reduce latency, packet loss, and jitter.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uses-of-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Uses of Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uses-of-computer-network/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/urh814lo8oh1qyspbl6o)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/niharika123/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[niharika123](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/niharika123/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n24\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network \\| Quality of Service and Multimedia\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nQuality of Service (QoS) is an important concept, particularly when working with multimedia applications.

Congestion control techniques can be broadly classified into two categories:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/congestion-control.jpg)\n\n### **Open Loop Congestion Control**\n\nOpen loop congestion control policies are applied to prevent congestion before it happens. The congestion control is handled either by the source or the destination.\n\n**Policies adopted by open loop congestion control \u2013**\n\n1. **Retransmission Policy :**\n\n    It is the policy in which retransmission of the packets are taken care of. If the sender feels that a sent packet is lost or corrupted, the packet needs to be retransmitted. This transmission may increase the congestion in the network.\n\n    To prevent congestion, retransmission timers must be designed to prevent congestion and also able to optimize efficiency.\n2. **Window Policy :**\n\n    The type of window at the sender\u2019s side may also affect the congestion. Several packets in the Go-back-n window are re-sent, although some packets may be received successfully at the receiver side. This duplication may increase the congestion in the network and make it worse.\n\n    Therefore, Selective repeat window should be adopted as it sends the specific packet that may have been lost.\n3. **Discarding Policy :**\n\n    A good discarding policy adopted by the routers is that the routers may prevent congestion and at the same time partially discard the corrupted or less sensitive packages and also be able to maintain the quality of a message.\n\n    In case of audio file transmission, routers can discard less sensitive packets to prevent congestion and also maintain the quality of the audio file.\n4. **Acknowledgment Policy :**\n\n    Since acknowledgements are also the part of the load in the network, the acknowledgment policy imposed by the receiver may also affect congestion. Several approaches can be used to prevent congestion related to acknowledgment.\n\n    The receiver should send acknowledgement for N packets rather than sending acknowledgement for a single packet. The receiver should send an acknowledgment only if it has to send a packet or a timer expires.\n5. **Admission Policy :**\n\n    In admission policy a mechanism should be used to prevent congestion. Switches in a flow should first check the resource requirement of a network flow before transmitting it further. If there is a chance of a congestion or there is a congestion in the network, router should deny establishing a virtual network connection to prevent further congestion.\n\n### **Closed Loop Congestion Control**\n\nClosed loop congestion control techniques are used to treat or alleviate congestion after it happens. Several techniques are used by different protocols; some of them are:\n\n**1\\. Backpressure :**\n\nBackpressure is a technique in which a congested node stops receiving packets from upstream node. This may cause the upstream node or nodes to become congested and reject receiving data from above nodes. Backpressure is a node-to-node congestion control technique that propagate in the opposite direction of data flow. The backpressure technique can be applied only to virtual circuit where each node has information of its above upstream node.\n\n![Backpressure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/data-flow-congestion.jpg)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In above diagram the 3rd node is congested and stops receiving packets as a result 2nd node may be get congested due to slowing down of the output data flow. Similarly 1st node may get congested and inform the source to slow down.\n\n**2\\. Choke Packet Technique :**\n\nChoke packet technique is applicable to both virtual networks as well as datagram subnets. A choke packet is a packet sent by a node to the source to inform it of congestion. Each router monitors its resources and the utilization at each of its output lines. Whenever the resource utilization exceeds the threshold value which is set by the administrator, the router directly sends a choke packet to the source giving it a feedback to reduce the traffic. The intermediate nodes through which the packets has traveled are not warned about congestion.\n\n![choke packet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/congestion-control-choke-packet.jpg)\n\n**3\\. Implicit Signaling :**\n\nIn implicit signaling, there is no communication between the congested nodes and the source. The source guesses that there is congestion in a network. For example when sender sends several packets and there is no acknowledgment for a while, one assumption is that there is a congestion.\n\n**4\\. Explicit Signaling :**\n\nIn explicit signaling, if a node experiences congestion it can explicitly send a packet to the source or destination to inform about congestion. The difference between choke packet and explicit signaling is that the signal is included in the packets that carry data rather than creating a different packet as in case of choke packet technique.\n\nExplicit signaling can occur in either forward or backward direction.\n\n- **Forward Signaling :** In forward signaling, a signal is sent in the direction of the congestion. The destination is warned about congestion. The receiver in this case adopt policies to prevent further congestion.\n- **Backward Signaling :** In backward signaling, a signal is sent in the opposite direction of the congestion. The source is warned about congestion and it needs to slow down.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Leaky bucket algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ARSHPREET_SINGH/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[ARSHPREET\\_SINGH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ARSHPREET_SINGH/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-transport-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Congestion control techniques can be broadly classified into two categories:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/congestion-control.jpg)\n\n### **Open Loop Congestion Control**\n\nOpen loop congestion control policies are applied to prevent congestion before it happens. The congestion control is handled either by the source or the destination.\n\n**Policies adopted by open loop congestion control \u2013**\n\n1. **Retransmission Policy :**\n\n    It is the policy in which retransmission of the packets are taken care of. If the sender feels that a sent packet is lost or corrupted, the packet needs to be retransmitted. This transmission may increase the congestion in the network.\n\n    To prevent congestion, retransmission timers must be designed to prevent congestion and also able to optimize efficiency.\n2. **Window Policy :**\n\n    The type of window at the sender\u2019s side may also affect the congestion. Several packets in the Go-back-n window are re-sent, although some packets may be received successfully at the receiver side. This duplication may increase the congestion in the network and make it worse.\n\n    Therefore, Selective repeat window should be adopted as it sends the specific packet that may have been lost.\n3. **Discarding Policy :**\n\n    A good discarding policy adopted by the routers is that the routers may prevent congestion and at the same time partially discard the corrupted or less sensitive packages and also be able to maintain the quality of a message.\n\n    In case of audio file transmission, routers can discard less sensitive packets to prevent congestion and also maintain the quality of the audio file.\n4. **Acknowledgment Policy :**\n\n    Since acknowledgements are also the part of the load in the network, the acknowledgment policy imposed by the receiver may also affect congestion. Several approaches can be used to prevent congestion related to acknowledgment.\n\n    The receiver should send acknowledgement for N packets rather than sending acknowledgement for a single packet. The receiver should send an acknowledgment only if it has to send a packet or a timer expires.\n5. **Admission Policy :**\n\n    In admission policy a mechanism should be used to prevent congestion. Switches in a flow should first check the resource requirement of a network flow before transmitting it further. If there is a chance of a congestion or there is a congestion in the network, router should deny establishing a virtual network connection to prevent further congestion.\n\n### **Closed Loop Congestion Control**\n\nClosed loop congestion control techniques are used to treat or alleviate congestion after it happens. Several techniques are used by different protocols; some of them are:\n\n**1\\. Backpressure :**\n\nBackpressure is a technique in which a congested node stops receiving packets from upstream node. This may cause the upstream node or nodes to become congested and reject receiving data from above nodes. Backpressure is a node-to-node congestion control technique that propagate in the opposite direction of data flow. The backpressure technique can be applied only to virtual circuit where each node has information of its above upstream node.\n\n![Backpressure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/data-flow-congestion.jpg)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In above diagram the 3rd node is congested and stops receiving packets as a result 2nd node may be get congested due to slowing down of the output data flow. Similarly 1st node may get congested and inform the source to slow down.\n\n**2\\. Choke Packet Technique :**\n\nChoke packet technique is applicable to both virtual networks as well as datagram subnets. A choke packet is a packet sent by a node to the source to inform it of congestion. Each router monitors its resources and the utilization at each of its output lines. Whenever the resource utilization exceeds the threshold value which is set by the administrator, the router directly sends a choke packet to the source giving it a feedback to reduce the traffic. The intermediate nodes through which the packets has traveled are not warned about congestion.\n\n![choke packet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/congestion-control-choke-packet.jpg)\n\n**3\\. Implicit Signaling :**\n\nIn implicit signaling, there is no communication between the congested nodes and the source. The source guesses that there is congestion in a network. For example when sender sends several packets and there is no acknowledgment for a while, one assumption is that there is a congestion.\n\n**4\\. Explicit Signaling :**\n\nIn explicit signaling, if a node experiences congestion it can explicitly send a packet to the source or destination to inform about congestion. The difference between choke packet and explicit signaling is that the signal is included in the packets that carry data rather than creating a different packet as in case of choke packet technique.\n\nExplicit signaling can occur in either forward or backward direction.\n\n- **Forward Signaling :** In forward signaling, a signal is sent in the direction of the congestion. The destination is warned about congestion. The receiver in this case adopt policies to prevent further congestion.\n- **Backward Signaling :** In backward signaling, a signal is sent in the opposite direction of the congestion. The source is warned about congestion and it needs to slow down.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Leaky bucket algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ARSHPREET_SINGH/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[ARSHPREET\\_SINGH](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ARSHPREET_SINGH/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n45\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-transport-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

It is designed to control the amount of data that a system can send or receive in some sort of period, ensuring that the traffic conforms to a specified rate.\n\nIt refers to traffic control mechanisms that seek to either differentiate performance based on application or network-operator requirements or provide predictable or guaranteed performance to applications, sessions, or traffic aggregates. It is something that data flow seeks to attain.\n\n## Need for Token Bucket Algorithm\n\n- Video and audio conferencing require a bounded delay and loss rate.\n- Video and audio streaming requires a bounded packet loss rate, it may not be so sensitive to delay.\n- a -critical applications (real-time control) in which bounded delay is considered to be an important factor.\n- Valuable applications should provide better services than less valuable applications.\n\n## Flow Characteristics of Token Bucket Algorithm\n\nFour types of characteristics are attributed to a flow: reliability, delay, jitter, and bandwidth.\n\n![Blank-diagram-(6)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240116153818/Blank-diagram-(6).png)Types of Characteristics for Quality of Service\n\n**Reliability**\n\nIt implies packet reached or not, information lost or not. Lack of reliability means losing a packet or acknowledgement, which entails re-transmission. Reliability requirements may differ from program to program. For example, it is more important that [electronic mail](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-electronic-mail/), file transfer and internet access have reliable transmissions than telephony or audio conferencing.\n\n#### Delay\n\nIt denotes source-to-destination delay. Different applications can tolerate delay in different degrees. Telephony, audio conferencing, video conferencing, and remote log-in need minimum delay, while delay in file transfer or e-mail is less important.\n\n#### Jitter\n\nJitter is the variation in delay for packets belonging in same flow. High jitter means the difference between delays is large; low jitter means the variation is small. For example, if packets 0,1,2,3s arrive at 6,7,8,9s it represents same delay. Jitter would signify that packets departed at 0,1,2,3s reach destination at 4,6,10,15s. Audio and video applications don't allow jitter.\n\n#### Bandwidth\n\nDifferent applications need different bandwidths. In video conferencing we need to send millions of bits per second to refresh a color screen while the total number of bits in an e-mail may not reach even a million.\n\n## Techniques to Improve QoS\n\nThere are several ways to improve QoS like Scheduling and Traffic shaping ,We will see each and every part of this in brief.\n\n### Scheduling\n\nPackets from different flows arrive at a switch or router for processing. A good scheduling technique treats the different flows in a fair and appropriate manner. Three scheduling techniques are:\n\n1. FIFO Queuing\n2. Priority Queuing\n3. Weighted Fair Queuing\n\nTo learn more about the scheduling techniques visit this article on [packet queuing and dropping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/packet-queuing-and-dropping-in-routers/).\n\n### Traffic Shaping\n\nIt is a mechanism to control the amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the network. The techniques used to shape traffic are: [leaky bucket](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/leaky-bucket-algorithm/) and token bucket.\n\n## Difference Between Token Bucket Algorithm and Leaky Bucket Algorithm\n\nThe differences between leaky and token bucket algorithm are:\n\n| Token Bucket Algorithm | Leaky Bucket Algorithm |\n| --- | --- |\n| It depends on tokens. | It does not depend on tokens. |\n| If bucket is full, token is discarded but not the packet. | If bucket is full, then packets are discarded. |\n| Packets can only transmit when there are enough tokens. | Packets are transmitted continuously. |\n| Allows large bursts to be sent at faster rate. Bucket has maximum capacity. | Sends the packet at a constant rate. |\n| The bucket holds tokens generated at regular intervals of time. | When the host has to send a packet , packet is thrown in bucket. |\n| If there is a ready packet , a token is removed from Bucket and packet is send. | Bursty traffic is converted into uniform traffic by leaky bucket. |\n| If there is no token in the bucket, then the packet cannot be sent. | In practice bucket is a finite queue outputs at finite rate. |\n\nLeaky bucket algorithm shapes bursty traffic into fixed-rate traffic by averaging the data rate. It may drop the packets if the bucket is full. But this technique is very restrictive. It does not credit an idle host. For example, if a host is not sending for a while, its bucket becomes empty. If the host has bursty data, the leaky bucket allows only an average rate. The time when the host is idle is not take into account. On the other hand, token bucket algorithm allows idle hosts to accumulate credit for the future in the form of tokens. And that is how it overcomes the shortcoming of leaky bucket algorithm.\n\n## Working of Token Bucket Algorithm\n\nIt allows bursty traffic at a regulated maximum rate. It allows idle hosts to accumulate credit for the future in the form of tokens. The system removes one token for every cell of data sent. For each tick of the clock the system send n tokens to the bucket. If n is 100 and host is idle for 100 ticks, bucket collects 10000 tokens. Host can now consume all these tokens with 10 cells per tick.\n\nToken bucket can be easily implemented with a counter. The token is initiated to zero. Each time a token is added, counter is incremented to 1. Each time a unit of data is sent, counter is decremented by 1. When the counter is zero, host cannot send data.\n\n![Process depicting how token bucket algorithm works](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240116162804/Blank-diagram-(7).png)Process depicting how token bucket algorithm works\n\n## Steps Involved in Token Bucket Algorithm\n\n**Step 1: Creation of Bucket:** An imaginative bucket is assigned a fixed capacity, known as \"rate limit\". It can hold up to a certain number of tokens.\n\n**Step 2: Refill the Bucket:** The bucket is dynamic; it gets periodically filled with tokens. Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate.\n\n**Step 3: Incoming Requests:** Upon receiving a request, we verify the presence of tokens in the bucket.\n\n**Step 4: Consume Tokens:** If there are tokens in the bucket, we pick one token from it. This means the request is allowed to proceed. The time of token consumption is also recorded.\n\n**Step 5: Empty Bucket:** If the bucket is depleted, meaning there are no tokens remaining, the request is denied. This precautionary measure prevents server or system overload, ensuring operation stays within predefined limits.\n\n## Advantage of Token Bucket over Leaky Bucket\n\n- If a bucket is full in tokens, then tokens are discarded and not the packets. While in leaky bucket algorithm, **packets are discarded**.\n- Token bucket can send large bursts at a **faster rate** while leaky bucket always sends packets at constant rate.\n- Token bucket ensures **predictable traffic shaping** as it allows for setting token arrival rate and maximum token count. In leaky bucket, such control may not be present.\n- Premium Quality of Service(QoS) is provided by prioritizing different traffic types through distinct token arrival rates. Such **flexibility in prioritization** is not provided by leaky bucket.\n- Token bucket is suitable for high-speed data transfer or streaming video content as it allows **transmission of large bursts of data**. As leaky bucket operates at a constant rate, it can lead to less efficient bandwidth utilization.\n- Token Bucket provides more **granular control** as administrators can adjust token arrival rate and maximum token count based on network requirements. Leaky Bucket has limited granularity in controlling traffic compared to Token Bucket.\n\n## Disadvantages of Token Bucket Algorithm\n\n- Token Bucket has the tendency to generate tokens at a fixed rate, even when the network traffic is not present. This is leads of accumulation of unused tokens during times when there is no traffic, hence leading to wastage.\n- Due to token accumulation, delays can introduced in the packet delivery. If the token bucket happens to be empty, packets will have to wait for new tokens, leading to increased latency and potential packet loss.\n- Token Bucket happens to be less flexible than leaky bucket when it comes to network traffic shaping. The fixed token generation rate cannot be easily altered to meet changing network requirements, unlike the adaptable nature of leaky bucket.\n- The implementation involved in token bucket can be more complex, especially due to the fact that different token generation rates are used for different traffic types. Configuration and management might be more difficult due to this.\n- Usage of large bursts of data may lead to inefficient use of bandwidth, and may cause congestion. Leaky bucket algorithm, on the other hand helps prevent congestion by limiting the amount of data sent at any given time, promoting more efficient bandwidth utilization.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Token Bucket Algorithm\n\n### What is leaky bucket algorithm?\n\n> Leaky bucket algorithm converts bursty traffic into a fixed rate traffic by maintaining a constant data output rate. Similar to water leaking from a bucket at a consistent rate, bursty data is stored in the bucket and sent out at an average rate. However, a drawback is that the leaky bucket imposes a constant data flow, disregarding the idle periods of the host and limiting adaptability to bursty data patterns.\n\n### Where is token bucket algorithm used?\n\n> Token bucket algorithm is generally used in packet-switched and telecommunication networks. It can be used to filter the requests depending on the levels of traffic currently present. It can find usage in functionalities like Spike Arrest and Rate Limiting operations.\n\n### What are the disadvantages of token bucket?\n\n> The main drawback of the token bucket algorithm is that it can be exploited by malicious or greedy clients. Since the client can make requests as fast as it wants, it can consume all the tokens in the bucket and starve other clients from accessing the API.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inductive-effect/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Inductive Effect](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inductive-effect/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/bsuysgna57bge59vwr1v)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tanyadiit7/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[tanyadiit7](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/tanyadiit7/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/geeks-premier-league/?ref=article_category)\n- [Geeks Premier League 2023](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/geeks-premier-league-2023/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[CSES Solutions - Weird Algorithm\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nConsider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer N.

Traffic shaping can prevent and reduce congestion in a network. It is a technique used to regulate data flow by controlling the rate at which packets are sent into the network.\u00a0There are 2 types of traffic shaping algorithms:\n\n1. Leaky Bucket\n2. Token Bucket\n\n## Leaky bucket algorithm\n\nSuppose we have a bucket in which we are pouring water at random points in time but we have to get water at a fixed rate to achieve this we will make a hole at the bottom of the bucket. This will ensure that the water coming out is at some fixed rate. If the bucket gets full, then we will stop pouring water into it.\n\nThe input rate can vary but the output rate remains constant. Similarly, in networking, a technique called leaky bucket can smooth out bursty traffic. Bursty chunks are stored in the bucket and sent out at an average rate.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/leakyTap-1.png)\n\nIn the above figure, we assume that the network has committed a bandwidth of 3 Mbps for a host. The use of the leaky bucket shapes the input traffic to make it conform to this commitment. In the above figure, the host sends a burst of data at a rate of 12 Mbps for 2s, for a total of 24 Mbits of data. The host is silent for 5 s and then sends data at a rate of 2 Mbps for 3 s, for a total of 6 Mbits of data. In all, the host has sent 30 Mbits of data in 10 s. The leaky bucket smooths out the traffic by sending out data at a rate of 3 Mbps during the same 10 s.\n\nWithout the leaky bucket, the beginning burst may have hurt the network by consuming more bandwidth than is set aside for this host. We can also see that the leaky bucket may prevent congestion.\n\n## How Does the Leaky Bucket Algorithm Work?\n\nA simple leaky bucket algorithm can be implemented using FIFO queue. A FIFO queue holds the packets. If the traffic consists of fixed-size packets (e.g., cells in ATM networks), the process removes a fixed number of packets from the queue at each tick of the clock. If the traffic consists of variable-length packets, the fixed output rate must be based on the number of bytes or bits.\n\nThe following is an algorithm for variable-length packets:\n\n1.

This means that if no packets are sent, tokens will accumulate in the bucket, which could result in wasted resources. In contrast, with leaky bucket the network only generates packets when there is traffic, which helps to conserve resources.\n- **Delay in packet delivery:** Token Bucket may introduce delay in packet delivery due to the accumulation of tokens. If the token bucket is empty, packets may need to wait for the arrival of new tokens, which can lead to increased latency and packet loss.\n- **Lack of flexibility:** Token Bucket is less flexible compared to leaky bucket in terms of shaping network traffic. This is because the token generation rate is fixed, and cannot be changed easily to meet the changing needs of the network. In contrast, leaky bucket can be adjusted more easily to adapt to changes in network traffic.\n- **Complexity:** Token Bucket can be more complex to implement compared to leaky bucket, especially when different token generation rates are used for different types of traffic. This can make it more difficult for network administrators to configure and manage the network.\n- **Inefficient use of bandwidth:** In some cases, Token Bucket may lead to inefficient use of bandwidth. This is because Token Bucket allows for large bursts of data to be sent at once, which can cause congestion and lead to packet loss. In contrast, leaky bucket helps to prevent congestion by limiting the amount of data that can be sent at any given time.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Leaky Bucket algorithm-FAQs\n\n### **What is QoS and how does it work?**\n\n> **Quality of Service (** [**QoS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-quality-of-service-and-multimedia/) **)** is a network management technique that prioritizes certain types of traffic to ensure reliable performance, especially for latency-sensitive applications like VoIP, video streaming, and gaming.\n\n### **What is congestion control in TCP?**\n\n> [Congestion control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-congestion-control/) in [TC **P**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) is a mechanism that prevents network congestion by adjusting the data transmission rate based on network conditions.\n\n### **What are the parameters of leaky bucket?**\n\n> The **Leaky Bucket Algorithm** has the following key parameters:\n>\n> 1. **Bucket Size (B)** \u2013 The maximum capacity of the bucket (queue), defining how much data can be stored before overflow occurs.\n> 2. **Leak Rate (R)** \u2013 The fixed rate at which packets (or tokens) are drained from the bucket, controlling the output flow.\n> 3. **Incoming Traffic (I)** \u2013 The rate at which data packets arrive into the bucket, which can be bursty or steady.\n> 4. **Time Interval (T)** \u2013 The duration over which the leak rate is applied, ensuring a consistent outflow of packets.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-congestion-control/?ref=next_article)\n\n[TCP Congestion Control](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-congestion-control/?ref=next_article)\n\nA\n\nAbhishek Kumar and Himanshu Gupta\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Transport Layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cn-transport-layer/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Network Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA Computer Network is a system where two or more devices are linked together to share data, resources, and information.

Two bands of frequency for the Wi-Fi are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. In short, it is the frequency of radio wave that carries data.\n\n**Two Frequencies of Wi-Fi signal :**\n\nWi-Fi routers that come with 2.4 GHz or5 GHz are called the single-band routers but a lot of new routers support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency they are called dual-band routers.\n\nThe 2.4 GHz is a common Wi-Fi band, but it is also used by other appliances like Bluetooth devices, wireless phones, cameras, etc. Because of the signal used by so many devices, the signal becomes overcrowded and speed becomes slow. So 5 GHz comes into the picture, It is new, and not commonly used, and because it is used by fewer devices there is no signal crowding and interference.\n\nThe 2.4 GHz transmits data at a slower speed than 5 GHz but does have a longer range than 5 GHz. The 5 GHz transmits data at a faster rate, but it has a shorter range because it has a higher frequency.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Parameter** | **2.4 GHz** | **5 GHz** |\n| Speed | Comparatively Low | High |\n| Range | High | Comparatively low |\n\n**Different standards of Wi-Fi :**\n\nThese are the Wi-Fi standards that evolved from 1997 to 2021. In 1997 IEEE created one standard and gave the name 802.11.\n\n**IEEE 802.11 \u2013**\n\n1. It was developed in 1997.\n2. Speed is about 2 Mbps (2 megabits per second).\n\n**IEEE 802.11a \u2013**\n\n1. This standard is developed in 1999.\n2. 802.11a is useful for commercial and industrial purposes.\n3. It works on a 5 GHz frequency.\n4. The maximum speed of 802.11a is 54 Mbps.\n5. This standard was made to avoid interference with other devices which use the 2.4 GHz band.\n\n**IEEE 802.11b \u2013**\n\n1. This standard also created with 802.11a in 1999.\n2. The difference is that it uses a 2.4 GHz frequency band.\n3. The speed of 802.11b is 11 Mbps.\n4. This standard is useful for home and domestic use.\n\n**IEEE 802.11g \u2013**\n\n1. This standard is designed in 2003.\n2. Basically, it has combined the properties of both 802.11a and 802.11b.\n3. The frequency band used in this is 2.4 GHz for better coverage.\n4. And the maximum speed is also up to 54 Mbps.\n\n**IEEE 802.11n \u2013**\n\n1. This was introduced in 2009.\n2. 802.11n operates on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, they are operated individually.\n3. The data transfer rate is around 600 Mbps.\n\n**IEEE 802.11ac \u2013**\n\n1. This standard is developed in 2013 named 802.11ac.\n2. Wi-Fi 802.11ac works on the 5 GHz band.\n3. The maximum speed of this standard is 1.3 Gbps.\n4. It gives less range because of the 5 GHz band, but nowadays most of the devices are working on 802.11n and 802.11ac standards.\n\n**IEEE 802.11ax \u2013**\n\n1. It is the newest and advanced version of Wi-Fi.\n2. This is released in 2019.\n3. Operates on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz for better coverage as well as better speed.\n4. User will get 10 Gbps of maximum speed around 30-40 % improvement over 802.11ac\n\n**Tabular Representation :**\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Version** | **Introduced in** | **Frequency band used** | **Maximum speed provided** |\n| IEEE 802.11a | 1999 | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps |\n| IEEE 802.11b | 1999 | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps |\n| IEEE 802.11g | 2003 | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps |\n| IEEE 802.11n | 2009 | Both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz | 600 Mbps |\n| IEEE 802.11ac | 2013 | 5 GHz | 1.3 Gbps |\n| IEEE 802.11ax | 2019 | Both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz | Up to 10 Gbps |\n\nNow recently Wi-Fi alliance announced the new naming scheme for Wi-Fi standards. Rather than the complex names like \u201c **802.11b**\u201d name now we can call as \u201c **Wi-Fi 1**\u201c, and similar for others. This will help consumers for easy to understand as 802.11 is difficult to understand.\n\n**New Naming Standards :**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Network** | **Wi-Fi Standard** |\n| IEEE 802.11b | Wi-Fi 1 |\n| IEEE 802.11a | Wi-Fi 2 |\n| IEEE 802.11g | Wi-Fi 3 |\n| IEEE 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 |\n| IEEE 802.11ac | Wi-Fi 5 |\n| IEEE 802.11ax | Wi-Fi 6 |\n\nThis is all about Wi-Fi and its various versions, In the future also, we may get a lot of improvements in the Wi-Fi system in speed and large range also.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-internet-standard/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Internet Standard?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-internet-standard/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/06xab1vwhg91p8upssrr)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/user282/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[user282](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/user282/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Wi-Fi Standards Explained\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nWi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity, and it is developed by an organization called IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) they set standards for the Wi-Fi system.

It is a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) technology and is used for data communications over smaller distances. This generation changed into being invented via Ericson in 1994. It operates within the unlicensed, business, scientific, and clinical (ISM) bands from 2.4 GHz to 2.485 GHz.\n\nBluetooth stages up to 10 meters. Depending upon the version, it presents information up to at least 1 Mbps or 3 Mbps. The spreading method that it uses is FHSS ( [Frequency-hopping unfold spectrum](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frequency-hopping-spread-spectrum-in-wireless-networks/)). A Bluetooth network is called a piconet and a group of interconnected piconets is called a scatter net.\n\n## Bluetooth\n\nBluetooth is a wireless technology that lets devices like phones, tablets, and headphones connect to each other and share information without needing cables. Bluetooth simply follows the principle of transmitting and receiving data using [radio waves](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radio-waves/). It can be paired with the other device which has also Bluetooth but it should be within the estimated communication range to connect. When two devices start to share data, they form a network called piconet which can further accommodate more than five devices.\n\n## **Key Features of Bluetooth**\n\n- The transmission capacity of Bluetooth is 720 kbps.\n- Bluetooth is a wireless technology.\n- Bluetooth is a Low-cost and short-distance radio communications standard.\n- Bluetooth is robust and flexible.\n- The basic architecture unit of Bluetooth is a [piconet](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-piconet/).\n\n## Architecture of Bluetooth\n\nThe architecture of Bluetooth defines two types of networks:\n\n### **Piconet**\n\nPiconet is a type of Bluetooth network that containsone primary node called the master node and seven active secondary nodes called slave nodes. Thus, we can say that there is a total of 8 active nodes which are present at a distance of 10 meters. The communication between the primary and secondary nodes can be one-to-one or one-to-many. Possible communication is only between the master and slave; Slave-slave communication is not possible. It also has 255 parked nodes, these are secondary nodes and cannot take participation in communication unless it gets converted to the active state.\n\n![piconet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241126152859662823/piconet.webp)\n\n### **Scatternet**\n\nIt is formed by using various piconets. A slave that is present in one piconet can act as master or we can say primary in another piconet. This kind of node can receive a message from a master in one piconet and deliver the message to its slave in the other piconet where it is acting as a master. This type of node is referred to as a bridge node. A station cannot be mastered in two piconets.\n\n![Scatternet](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240228134125/bluetootharchitecture.jpg)\n\n## Bluetooth Protocol Stack\n\n- **Radio (RF) Layer:**\u00a0It specifies the details of the air interface, including frequency, the use of frequency hopping and transmit power. It performs modulation/demodulation of the data into [RF signals](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-radio-frequency-identification-rfid/). It defines the physical characteristics of Bluetooth transceivers. It defines two types of physical links: connection-less and connection-oriented.\n- **Baseband Link Layer:**\u00a0The baseband is the digital engine of a Bluetooth system and is equivalent to the [MAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mac-address-in-computer-network/) sublayer in LANs. \u00a0It performs the connection establishment within a piconet, addressing, packet format, timing and power control.\n- **Link Manager Protocol Layer:**\u00a0It performs the management of the already established links which includes authentication and encryption processes.\u00a0It is responsible for creating the links, monitoring their health, and terminating them gracefully upon command or failure.\n- **Logical Link Control and Adaption (L2CAP) Protocol Layer:**\u00a0It is also known as the heart of the Bluetooth protocol stack. It allows the communication between upper and lower layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack. It packages the data packets received from upper layers into the form expected by lower layers. It also performs segmentation and [multiplexing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiplexing-channel-sharing-in-computer-network/).\n- **Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) Layer:**\u00a0It is short for Service Discovery Protocol. It allows discovering the services available on another Bluetooth-enabled device.\n- **RF Comm Layer:**\u00a0It is a cabal replacement protocol. It is short for Radio Frontend Component. It provides a serial interface with [WAP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wireless-application-protocol/) and OBEX. It also provides emulation of serial ports over the logical link control and adaption protocol(L2CAP). The protocol is based on the ETSI standard TS 07.10.\n- **OBEX:**\u00a0It is short for Object Exchange. It is a communication protocol to exchange objects between 2 devices.\n- **WAP:**\u00a0It is short for Wireless Access Protocol. It is used for internet access.\n- **TCS:**\u00a0It is short for [Telephony Control Protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-telephony-protocol-h-323/). It provides telephony service.\u00a0The basic function of this layer is call control (setup & release) and group management for the gateway serving multiple devices.\n- **Application Layer:** It enables the user to interact with the application.\n\n![Bluetooth Protocol Stack](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240228133129/bluetoothprotocolstack.jpg)\n\nBluetooth Protocol Stack\n\n## Types of Bluetooth\n\nVarious types of Bluetooth are available in the market nowadays. Let us look at them.\n\n- **In-Car Headset:** One can make calls from the car speaker system without the use of mobile phones.\n- **Stereo Headset:** To listen to music in car or in music players at home.\n- **Webcam:** One can link the camera with the help of Bluetooth with their laptop or phone.\n- **Bluetooth-Equipped Printer:** The printer can be used when connected via Bluetooth with mobile phone or laptop.\n- **Bluetooth Global Positioning System (GPS):** To use [Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gps-full-form/) in cars, one can connect their phone with car system via Bluetooth to fetch the directions of the address.\n\n## Applications of Bluetooth\n\n- It can be used in wireless headsets, wireless [PANs, and LANs.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/)\n- It can connect a digital camera wireless to a mobile phone.\n- It can transfer data in terms of videos, songs, photographs, or files from one cell phone to another cell phone or computer.\n- It is used in the sectors of Medical healthcare, sports and fitness, Military.\n\n## Advantages\n\n- It is a low-cost and easy-to-use device.\n- It can also penetrate through walls.\n- It creates an [Ad-hoc connection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-ad-hoc-network-and-its-problems/) immediately without any wires.\n- It is used for voice and data transfer.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- It can be hacked and hence, less secure.\n- It has a slow data transfer rate of 3 Mbps.\n- Bluetooth communication does not support [routing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-routing/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to connect and communicate with each other over short distances. It is commonly used for things like connecting headphones, keyboards, and transferring files between devices.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Bluetooth \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What is Bluetooth range?\n\n> Commercial electronics bluetooth have a range of around 33 feet , which includes the majority of smartphones, headphones, earbuds, and portable speakers. Bluetooth versions 5.0 and higher improve quality and range.\n\n### How fast is Bluetooth?\n\n> Approximately 1 Mbps is the transmission rate of Bluetooth device when employing frequency-shift keying modulation.

It is a technology of home networking. ZigBee is a technological standard created for controlling and sensing the network. As we know that ZigBee is the Personal Area Network of task group 4 so it is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is created by Zigbee Alliance.\n\nZigBee is an open, global, packet-based protocol designed to provide an easy-to-use architecture for secure, reliable, low power wireless networks. Flow or process control equipment can be place anywhere and still communicate with the rest of the system. It can also be moved, since the network doesn\u2019t care about the physical location of a sensor, pump or valve.\n\n> IEEE802.15.4 developed the PHY and MAC layer whereas, the ZigBee takes care of \u00a0upper higher layers.\n\nZigBee is a standard that addresses the need for very low-cost implementation of Low power devices with Low data rates for short-range wireless communications.\n\nIEEE 802.15.4 supports star and peer-to-peer topologies. The ZigBee specification supports star and two kinds of peer-to-peer topologies, mesh and cluster tree. ZigBee-compliant devices are sometimes specified as supporting point-to-point and point-to-multipoint topologies.\n\n**Why another short-range communication standard??**\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211104164208/12-660x282.png)\n\n### Types of ZigBee Devices:\n\n- **Zigbee Coordinator Device:** It communicates with routers. This device is used for connecting the devices.\n- **Zigbee Router:** It is used for passing the data between devices.\n- **Zigbee End Device:** It is the device that is going to be controlled.\n\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20211103161020/Publication1-660x416.png)\n\n### General Characteristics of Zigbee Standard:\n\n- Low Power Consumption\n- Low Data Rate (20- 250 kbps)\n- Short-Range (75-100 meters)\n- Network Join Time (~ 30 msec)\n- Support Small and Large Networks (up to 65000 devices (Theory); 240 devices (Practically))\n- Low Cost of Products and Cheap Implementation (Open Source Protocol)\n- Extremely low-duty cycle.\n- 3 frequency bands with 27 channels.\n\n**Operating Frequency Bands** (Only one channel will be selected for use in a network):\n\n1. **Channel 0**: 868 MHz (Europe)\n2. **Channel 1-10**: 915 MHz (the US and Australia)\n3. **Channel 11-26**: 2.4 GHz (Across the World)\n\n### Features of Zigbee:\n\n**1\\. Stochastic addressing:** A device is assigned a random address and announced. Mechanism for address conflict resolution. Parents node don\u2019t need to maintain assigned address table.\n\n**2\\. Link Management:** Each node maintains quality of links to neighbors. Link quality is used as link cost in routing.\n\n**3\\. Frequency Agility:** Nodes experience interference report to channel manager, which then selects another channel\n\n**4\\. Asymmetric Link:** Each node has different transmit power and sensitivity. Paths may be asymmetric.\n\n**5\\. Power Management:** Routers and Coordinators use main power. End Devices use batteries.\n\n**Advantages of Zigbee:**\n\n1. Designed for low power consumption.\n2. Provides network security and application support services operating on the top of IEEE.\n3. Zigbee makes possible completely networks homes where all devices are able to communicate and be\n4. Use in smart home\n5. Easy implementation\n6. Adequate security features.\n7. **Low cost**: Zigbee chips and modules are relatively inexpensive, which makes it a cost-effective solution for IoT applications.\n8. **Mesh networking:** Zigbee uses a mesh network topology, which allows for devices to communicate with each other without the need for a central hub or router. This makes it ideal for use in smart home applications where devices need to communicate with each other and with a central control hub.\n9. **Reliability:** Zigbee protocol is designed to be highly reliable, with robust mechanisms in place to ensure that data is delivered reliably even in adverse conditions.\n\n**Disadvantages of Zigbee :**\n\n1. **Limited range:** Zigbee has a relatively short range compared to other wireless communications protocols, which can make it less suitable for certain types of applications or for use in large buildings.\n2. **Limited data rate:** Zigbee is designed for low-data-rate applications, which can make it less suitable for applications that require high-speed data transfer.\n3. **Interoperability:** Zigbee is not as widely adopted as other IoT protocols, which can make it difficult to find devices that are compatible with each other.\n4. **Security:** Zigbee\u2019s security features are not as robust as other IoT protocols, making it more vulnerable to hacking and other security threats.\n\n### Zigbee Network Topologies:\n\n- **Star Topology** (ZigBee Smart Energy): Consists of a coordinator and several end devices, end devices communicate only with the coordinator.\n- **Mesh Topology** (Self Healing Process): Mesh topology consists of one coordinator, several routers, and end devices.\n- **Tree Topology**: In this topology, the network consists of a central node which is a coordinator, several routers, and end devices. the function of the router is to extend the network coverage.\n\n### Architecture of Zigbee:\n\nZigbee architecture is a combination of 6 layers.\n\n1. Application Layer\n2. Application Interface Layer\n3. Security Layer\n4. Network Layer\n5. Medium Access Control Layer\n6. Physical Layer\n\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200302142351/Untitled-Diagram76.png)\n\n- **Physical layer:** The lowest two layers i.e the physical and the MAC (Medium Access Control) Layer are defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications. The Physical layer is closest to the hardware and directly controls and communicates with the Zigbee radio. The physical layer translates the data packets in the over-the-air bits for transmission and vice-versa during the reception.\n- **Medium Access Control layer (MAC layer):** The layer is responsible for the interface between the physical and network layer. The MAC layer is also responsible for providing PAN ID and also network discovery through beacon requests.\n- **Network layer:** This layer acts as an interface between the MAC layer and the application layer. It is responsible for mesh networking.\n- **Application layer:** The application layer in the Zigbee stack is the highest protocol layer and it consists of the application support sub-layer and Zigbee device object. It contains manufacturer-defined applications.\n\n**Channel Access:**\n\n1. **Contention Based Method** (Carrier-Sense Multiple Access With Collision Avoidance Mechanism)\n2. **Contention Free Method** (Coordinator dedicates a specific time slot to each device (Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS)))\n\n### Zigbee Applications:\n\n1. Home Automation\n2. Medical Data Collection\n3. Industrial Control Systems\n4. meter reading system\n5. light control system\n6. Commercial\n7. Government Markets Worldwide\n8. Home Networking\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wardriving-introduction/?ref=next_article)\n\n[WarDriving - Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wardriving-introduction/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/96s6sg29cxys3ope0lkl)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ramswarup_kulhary/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[ramswarup\\_kulhary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/ramswarup_kulhary/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Introduction of ZigBee\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nZigBee is a Personal Area Network task group with low rate task group 4.

We all have seen various generations in our life. Let\u2019s discuss them one by one.\n\n**0th \u00a0Generation:**\n\n- Pre-cell phone mobile telephony technology, such as radio telephones some had in cars before the arrival of cell phones.\n- Communication was possible through voice only.\n- These mobile telephones were usually mounted in cars or trucks.\n\n**1G (1st Generation):**\n\n- First-time calling was introduced in mobile systems.\n- It used analog signals.\n- It used an FDD scheme and typically allocated a bandwidth of 25 Mhz.\n- The coverage area was small.\n- No roaming support between various operators.\n- Low sound quality.\n- Speed:- 2.4 kbps.\n\n**2G (2nd Generation) :**\n\n- Shifted from analog to digital.\n- It supported voice and SMS both.\n- Supported all 4 sectors of the wireless industry namely Digital cellular, Mobile Data, PCS, WLAN,\n- Moderate mobile data service.\n- 2G WLAN provided a high data rate & large area coverage.\n- Speed:- 64 kbps.\n\n**2.5G** came after **2G** which used the concept of GPRS. Streaming was also introduced and mail services too. Then came **2.75G** or EDGE which was faster in providing services than 2.5G. It gave faster internet speed up to 128kbps and also used edge connection.\n\n**3G (3rd Generation) :**\n\n- The Internet system was improved.\n- Better system and capacity.\n- Offers high-speed wireless internet.\n- The connection used was UMTS and WCMA.\n- Speed:- 2mbps.\n\n**4G (4th Generation) :**\n\n- IP-based protocols.\n- LTE (Long term evaluation) was mainly for the internet.\n- Vo-LTE (Voice over LTE) is for both voice and the internet.\n- Freedom and flexibility to select any desired service with reasonable QoS.\n- High usability.\n- Supports multimedia service at a low transmission cost.\n- HD Quality Streaming.\n- Speed:-100mbps.\n\n[**5G (5th Generation)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-5g-wireless-technology-and-how-it-works/) **:** It is yet to come in many countries but here are some notable points about 5G.\n\n- Higher data rates.\n- Connectivity will be more fast and more secure,\n- Data Latency will be reduced to a great level.\n- Massive network capacity.\n- It is 30 times faster than 4G.\n- There would be more flexibility in the network.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/friis-equation-in-wireless-communication/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Friis Equation in Wireless Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/friis-equation-in-wireless-communication/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sourabhduklan/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[sourabhduklan](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sourabhduklan/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Generations of wireless communication\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nWe have made very huge improvements in wireless communication and have expanded the capabilities of our wireless communication system.

Companies offering such kinds of [cloud computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/architecture-of-cloud-computing/) services are called [_cloud providers_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-5-cloud-platform-service-providers-in-2020/) and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage. Grids and clusters are the foundations for cloud computing.\n\n#### Types of Cloud Computing\n\nMost cloud computing services fall into five broad categories:\n\n1. Software as a service (SaaS)\n2. Platform as a service (PaaS)\n3. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)\n4. Anything/Everything as a service (XaaS)\n5. Function as a Service (FaaS)\n\nThese are sometimes called the **cloud computing stack** because they are built on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they are different, makes it easier to accomplish your goals. These abstraction layers can also be viewed as a **layered architecture** where services of a higher layer can be composed of services of the underlying layer i.e, SaaS can provide Infrastructure.\n\n### Software as a Service(SaaS)\n\n[Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-as-a-service-saas/) is a way of delivering services and applications over the Internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software, we simply access it via the Internet, freeing ourselves from the complex software and hardware management. It removes the need to install and run applications on our own computers or in the data centers eliminating the expenses of hardware as well as software maintenance.\n\nSaaS provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a **pay-as-you-go** basis from a cloud service provider. Most SaaS applications can be run directly from a web browser without any downloads or installations required. The SaaS applications are sometimes called **Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software.**\n\n#### **Advantages of SaaS**\n\n1. **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for what you use.\n2. **Reduced time:** Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without needing to download and install any software. This reduces the time spent in installation and configuration and can reduce the issues that can get in the way of the software deployment.\n3. **Accessibility:** We can Access app data from anywhere.\n4. **Automatic updates:** Rather than purchasing new software, customers rely on a SaaS provider to automatically perform the updates.\n5. **Scalability:** It allows the users to access the services and features on-demand.\n\nThe various companies providing _Software as a service_ are Cloud9 Analytics, Salesforce.com, Cloud Switch, Microsoft Office 365, Big Commerce, Eloqua, dropBox, and Cloud Tran.\n\n**Disadvantages of Saas :**\n\n1. **Limited customization**: SaaS solutions are typically not as customizable as on-premises software, meaning that users may have to work within the constraints of the SaaS provider\u2019s platform and may not be able to tailor the software to their specific needs.\n2. **Dependence on internet connectivity**: SaaS solutions are typically cloud-based, which means that they require a stable internet connection to function properly. This can be problematic for users in areas with poor connectivity or for those who need to access the software in offline environments.\n3. **Security concerns:** SaaS providers are responsible for maintaining the security of the data stored on their servers, but there is still a risk of data breaches or other security incidents.\n4. **Limited control over data:** SaaS providers may have access to a user\u2019s data, which can be a concern for organizations that need to maintain strict control over their data for regulatory or other reasons.\n\n### Platform as a Service\n\n[PaaS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/) is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services over the internet. PaaS services are hosted in the cloud and accessed by users simply via their web browser.\n\nA PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. Thus, the development and deployment of the application take place **independent of the hardware**.\n\nThe consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. To make it simple, take the example of an annual day function, you will have two options either to create a venue or to rent a venue but the function is the same.\n\n#### **Advantages of PaaS:**\n\n1. **Simple and convenient for users:** It provides much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser.\n2. **Cost-Effective:** It charges for the services provided on a per-use basis thus eliminating the expenses one may have for on-premises hardware and software.\n3. **Efficiently managing the lifecycle:** It is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.\n4. **Efficiency:** It allows for higher-level programming with reduced complexity thus, the overall development of the application can be more effective.\n\nThe various companies providing _Platform as a service_ are Amazon Web services Elastic Beanstalk, Salesforce, Windows Azure, Google App Engine, cloud Bees and IBM smart cloud.\n\n**Disadvantages of Paas:**\n\n1. **Limited control over infrastructure:** PaaS providers typically manage the underlying infrastructure and take care of maintenance and updates, but this can also mean that users have less control over the environment and may not be able to make certain customizations.\n2. **Dependence on the provider**: Users are dependent on the PaaS provider for the availability, scalability, and reliability of the platform, which can be a risk if the provider experiences outages or other issues.\n3. **Limited flexibility:** PaaS solutions may not be able to accommodate certain types of workloads or applications, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.\n\n### Infrastructure as a Service\n\nInfrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a service model that delivers computer infrastructure on an outsourced basis to support various operations. Typically IaaS is a service where infrastructure is provided as outsourcing to enterprises such as networking equipment, devices, database, and web servers.\n\nIt is also known as **Hardware as a Service (HaaS).** IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month. Some providers also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use.\n\nIt simply provides the underlying operating systems, security, networking, and servers for developing such applications, and services, and deploying development tools, databases, etc.\n\n#### **Advantages of IaaS:**\n\n1. **Cost-Effective:** Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost and IaaS customers pay on a per-user basis, typically by the hour, week, or month.\n2. **Website hosting:** Running websites using IaaS can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.\n3. **Security:** The IaaS Cloud Provider may provide better security than your existing software.\n4. **Maintenance:** There is no need to manage the underlying data center or the introduction of new releases of the development or underlying software. This is all handled by the IaaS Cloud Provider.\n\nThe various companies providing _Infrastructure as a service_ are [Amazon web services](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-web-services-setting-up-an-aws-account/), Bluestack, IBM, Openstack, Rackspace, and Vmware.\n\n**Disadvantages of laaS :**\n\n1. **Limited control over infrastructure:** IaaS providers typically manage the underlying infrastructure and take care of maintenance and updates, but this can also mean that users have less control over the environment and may not be able to make certain customizations.\n2. **Security concerns**: Users are responsible for securing their own data and applications, which can be a significant undertaking.\n3. **Limited access:** Cloud computing may not be accessible in certain regions and countries due to legal policies.\n\n### Anything as a Service\n\nIt is also known as Everything as a Service. Most of the cloud service providers nowadays offer anything as a service that is a compilation of all of the above services including some additional services.\n\n**Advantages of XaaS:**\n\n1. **Scalability:** XaaS solutions can be easily scaled up or down to meet the changing needs of an organization.\n2. **Flexibility:** XaaS solutions can be used to provide a wide range of services, such as storage, databases, networking, and software, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization.\n3. **Cost-effectiveness**: XaaS solutions can be more cost-effective than traditional on-premises solutions, as organizations only pay for the services.\n\n**Disadvantages of XaaS:**\n\n1. **Dependence on the provider:** Users are dependent on the XaaS provider for the availability, scalability, and reliability of the service, which can be a risk if the provider experiences outages or other issues.\n2. **Limited flexibility**: XaaS solutions may not be able to accommodate certain types of workloads or applications, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.\n3. **Limited integration:** XaaS solutions may not be able to integrate with existing systems and data sources, which can limit the value of the solution for certain organizations.\n\n### **Function as a Service :**\n\nFaaS is a type of cloud computing service. It provides a platform for its users or customers to develop, compute, run and deploy the code or entire application as functions. It allows the user to entirely develop the code and update it at any time without worrying about the maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. The developed code can be executed with response to the specific event. It is also **as same as PaaS**.\n\nFaaS is an event-driven execution model. It is implemented in the serverless container. When the application is developed completely, the user will now trigger the event to execute the code. Now, the triggered event makes response and activates the servers to execute it. The servers are nothing but the Linux servers or any other servers which is managed by the vendor completely. Customer does not have clue about any servers which is why they do not need to maintain the server hence it is **serverless architecture.**\n\nBoth PaaS and FaaS are providing the same functionality but there is still some differentiation in terms of Scalability and Cost.\n\nFaaS, provides auto-scaling up and scaling down depending upon the demand. PaaS also provides scalability but here users have to configure the scaling parameter depending upon the demand.\n\nIn FaaS, users only have to pay for the number of execution time happened. In PaaS, users have to pay for the amount based on pay-as-you-go price regardless of how much or less they use.\n\n**Advantages of FaaS :**\n\n- **Highly Scalable:** Auto scaling is done by the provider depending upon the demand.\n- **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for the number of events executed.\n- **Code Simplification:** FaaS allows the users to upload the entire application all at once. It allows you to write code for independent functions or similar to those functions.\n- Maintenance of code is enough and no need to worry about the servers.\n- Functions can be written in any programming language.\n- Less control over the system.\n\nThe various companies providing Function as a Service are Amazon Web Services \u2013 Firecracker, Google \u2013 Kubernetes, Oracle \u2013 Fn, Apache OpenWhisk \u2013 IBM, OpenFaaS,\n\n**Disadvantages of FaaS :**\n\n1. **Cold start latency**: Since FaaS functions are event-triggered, the first request to a new function may experience increased latency as the function container is created and initialized.\n2. **Limited control over infrastructure:** FaaS providers typically manage the underlying infrastructure and take care of maintenance and updates, but this can also mean that users have less control over the environment and may not be able to make certain customizations.\n3. **Security concerns:** Users are responsible for securing their own data and applications, which can be a significant undertaking.\n4. **Limited scalability**: FaaS functions may not be able to handle high traffic or large number of requests.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Platform As A Service (PaaS) and its Types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/platform-as-a-service-paas-and-its-types/?ref=next_article)\n\n[H](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Harshita%20Pandey/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Harshita Pandey](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Harshita%20Pandey/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Cloud Computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/cloud-computing/?ref=article_category)\n- [Cloud-Computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/cloud-computing/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Cloud Computing Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCloud computing is a technology that enables us to create, configure, and customize applications through an internet connection.

Whether you\u2019re looking to **protect your data**, **bypass geo-restrictions**, or **enhance online security**, a VPN ( [Virtual Private Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-vpn-and-how-it-works/)) is an essential tool in 2025. However, not all VPNs are created equal, and understanding the differences between **free and premium VPN services** can help you make the right choice.\n\nThis guide breaks down the **key differences between free and paid VPNs**, helping you to take the right decision between whether using a free VPN is a good idea or paid VPN is better? **Explore this comparison and find out which VPN solution is right for you**.\n\n> **Disclaimer**: Carefully evaluate the features of any VPN provider before use to ensure your data remains secure and private.\n\n![Free-VPN-vs-Paid-VPN](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250212185800700319/Free-VPN-vs-Paid-VPN.webp)\n\nFree VPN vs Paid VPN\n\n## **What is a VPN and Why Do You Need One?**\n\nA **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** encrypts your internet connection, hiding your [**IP address**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/) and protecting your **online activity** from hackers, ISPs, and government surveillance.\n\n### **Key Benefits of Using a VPN:**\n\n- **Enhanced Privacy:** Prevents tracking and data collection by websites and third parties.\n- **Secure Public Wi-Fi Use:** Encrypts your connection to protect data from cyber threats.\n- **Access Geo-Restricted Content:** Unblocks streaming platforms like **Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and Disney+** from different regions.\n- **Avoid Bandwidth Throttling:** Prevents ISPs from slowing down your internet speed.\n\nWhile **both free and paid VPNs** offer these benefits, their effectiveness varies significantly.\n\n## **Free VPN vs Paid VPN: A Detailed Comparison**\n\n| **Feature** | **Free VPN** | **Paid VPN** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Security & Privacy** | Weak encryption, data logging concerns | Strong encryption (AES-256), strict no-logs policy |\n| **Speed & Performance** | Slower speeds due to limited servers | High-speed servers with unlimited bandwidth |\n| **Data Limits** | Typically 500MB \u2013 10GB per month | Unlimited data usage |\n| **Server Locations** | Limited number of servers, often congested | Thousands of global servers with optimized locations |\n| **Streaming & Torrenting** | Usually blocked on major platforms | Works with Netflix, Disney+, and supports P2P traffic |\n| **Ads & Malware Risks** | Some VPNs show ads or collect data | No ads, premium security features |\n| **Customer Support** | Limited or no support | 24/7 live chat and email support |\n| **Cost** | Free | Monthly or yearly subscription plans |\n\n## **Why Free VPNs May Not Be the Best Option in 2025**\n\nFree VPNs may seem like a **cost-effective** solution, but they come with **significant drawbacks** that compromise privacy, security, and overall user experience.\n\n### **1\\. Security and Privacy Risks**\n\nMost free VPN providers **log user data** and may **sell browsing activity to third parties**. This completely defeats the purpose of using a VPN for privacy.\n\n- **Many free VPNs lack AES-256 encryption**, making them vulnerable to cyber threats.\n- **Some free VPNs inject ads** into web pages or contain malware, putting users at risk.\n- **Data leaks are common**, exposing user IP addresses and online activities.\n\n> **Example:** Studies have found that **75% of free VPNs contain tracking libraries**, meaning they **monitor user behavior instead of protecting it**.\n\n### **2\\. Limited Speed and Data Caps**\n\nFree VPNs **restrict bandwidth and speed**, making them unsuitable for high-data activities like **streaming, gaming, and torrenting**.\n\n1. Most free VPNs **throttle speeds** to reduce server congestion.\n2. Monthly data caps of **500MB \u2013 10GB** make them impractical for regular use.\n3. High latency makes gaming or VoIP calls (e.g., Zoom, Skype) frustrating.\n\n> **Example:** A popular free VPN like **TunnelBear** offers only **500MB per month**, which is insufficient for streaming even a single HD movie.\n\n### **3\\. Poor Server Availability**\n\nFree VPNs offer **a limited number of servers**, usually in **highly congested locations**, leading to:\n\n- Frequent disconnections and slow speeds.\n- Inability to bypass **geo-restrictions** on streaming platforms.\n- High server loads, reducing performance and stability.\n\n> **Example:** Free VPNs often fail to unblock **Netflix, Hulu, or BBC iPlayer**, while paid VPNs offer **dedicated streaming servers**.\n\n## **Why Paid VPNs Are Worth the Investment**\n\nPaid VPNs provide **uncompromised security, speed, and access to global content**. If you want a **fast, private, and unrestricted internet experience**, a paid VPN is the better choice.\n\n### **1\\. Advanced Security and Privacy Features**\n\nPaid VPNs use **military-grade encryption (AES-256)** to protect your online activities.\n\n- **Strict No-Logs Policy:** Ensures your browsing data is never recorded or sold.\n- **Kill Switch Feature:** Disconnects internet if VPN drops, preventing IP leaks.\n- **Ad & Malware Blockers:** Prevents tracking and cyber threats.\n- **Double VPN & Split Tunneling:** Adds an extra layer of anonymity.\n\n> **Example:** **NordVPN and ExpressVPN** use **RAM-only servers**, meaning data is **never stored** and gets erased with every reboot.\n\n### **2\\. High-Speed Connections with Unlimited Bandwidth**\n\nPaid VPNs optimize servers for **fast and reliable connections**, essential for:\n\n- **Streaming in 4K without buffering**\n- **Smooth online gaming and VoIP calls**\n- **Unlimited torrenting and file downloads**\n\n> **Example:** **ExpressVPN and Surfshark** provide **unlimited bandwidth** and **high-speed 10Gbps servers** in 90+ countries.\n\n### **3\\. Access to Streaming and Torrenting**\n\nMost free VPNs **do not work** with **Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, or Amazon Prime Video**, while paid VPNs have **dedicated streaming servers**.\n\n- **Works with Netflix, Disney+, and HBO Max**\n- **Supports P2P traffic for torrenting**\n- **Bypasses strict VPN blocks with advanced obfuscation**\n\n> **Example:** **CyberGhost VPN** offers optimized servers **labeled for specific streaming services**, ensuring hassle-free access.\n\n### **4\\. Large Server Network and Global Access**\n\nPaid VPNs offer **thousands of servers worldwide**, reducing congestion and improving performance.\n\n- More servers mean **less overcrowding** and **faster speeds**.\n- Multiple country options allow access to **restricted content globally**.\n- Dedicated IP addresses available for **secure remote access**.\n\n> **Example:** **NordVPN** provides **5,600+ servers** across **60+ countries**, ensuring reliable global coverage.\n\n### **5\\. Reliable Customer Support**\n\nPaid VPNs offer **24/7 live chat and email support**, while free VPNs provide **little to no customer assistance**.\n\n- Instant help with **setup, troubleshooting, and streaming issues**.\n- Refund policies (30-day money-back guarantees) ensure risk-free trials.\n\n> **Example:** **ExpressVPN and Surfshark** offer **live chat support**, helping users fix issues within minutes.\n\n## **Free or Paid VPN in 2025:** which should you choose **?**\n\n| **Choose a Free VPN If:** | **Choose a Paid VPN If:** |\n| --- | --- |\n| You only need a VPN occasionally for basic browsing | You want full security, speed, and unrestricted access |\n| You don\u2019t mind limited speeds and data caps | You stream, game, or download frequently |\n| You don\u2019t need to access geo-blocked streaming services | You need a VPN that works with Netflix, Hulu, and more |\n| You are willing to risk potential data collection | You want complete privacy with no logs |\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nA **free VPN is not a long-term solution** if you prioritize **privacy, security, and performance**. While it may be useful for **temporary browsing needs**, the **data collection, slow speeds, and limited functionality** make it an unreliable choice.\n\n- For **uninterrupted streaming, secure browsing, and unrestricted global access**, a **paid VPN is the best investment** in 2025.\n- If you are serious about online security and privacy, **choosing a premium VPN** with **fast servers, strong encryption, and zero-logs policy** is the safest and most effective option.\n\n## Free VPN vs Paid VPN \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Is it better to get a free VPN or paid?**\n\n> A **paid VPN** is generally better than a free VPN for most users.

In our day to day life we are using the Wireless Wide Area Network of different sizes and depending on it delivery of telephonic calls, Web pages and streaming video, data sharing occurs. WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) differs from WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network) technology wise for example when WLAN uses WiFi to connect and transfer data, WWAN uses telecommunication cellular network technologies such as 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G to transfer data. WWAN not only always refers to a wide area rather a closed area with large geographic coverage is also considered as WWAN. For example a MANET (Mobile ad hoc networks) with nodes on buildings and towers or planes. A Low Power and low bit rate Wireless Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is also considered as WWAN.

There is a requirement for a hypervisor to operate networking software and procedures like load balancing and routing by virtual computers. A network functions virtualization standard was first proposed at the OpenFlow World Congress in 2012 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), a group of service providers that includes AT&T, China Mobile, BT Group, Deutsche Telekom, and many more.\n\n## Need of NFV:\n\nWith the help of NFV, it becomes possible to separate communication services from specialized hardware like routers and firewalls. This eliminates the need for buying new hardware and network operations can offer new services on demand. With this, it is possible to deploy network components in a matter of hours as opposed to months as with conventional networking. Furthermore, the virtualized services can run on less expensive generic servers.\n\n## Advantages:\n\n- Lower expenses as it follows Pay as you go which implies companies only pay for what they require.\n- Less equipment as it works on virtual machines rather than actual machines which leads to fewer appliances, which lowers operating expenses as well.\n- Scalability of network architecture is quite quick and simple using virtual functions in NFV. As a result, it does not call for the purchase of more hardware.\n\n## Working:\n\nUsage of software by virtual machines enables to carry out the same networking tasks as conventional hardware. The software handles the task of load balancing, routing, and firewall security. Network engineers can automate the provisioning of the virtual network and program all of its various components using a hypervisor or software-defined networking controller.\n\n![Structure of NFV](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221115122230/NFV1.png)\n\n## Benefits of NFV:\n\n- Many service providers believe that advantages outweigh the issues of NFV.\n- Traditional hardware-based networks are time-consuming as these require network administrators to buy specialized hardware units, manually configure them, then join them to form a network. For this skilled or well-equipped worker is required.\n- It costs less as it works under the management of a hypervisor, which is significantly less expensive than buying specialized hardware that serves the same purpose.\n- Easy to configure and administer the network because of a virtualized network. As a result, network capabilities may be updated or added instantly.\n\n## Risks of NFV:\n\nSecurity hazards do exist, though, and network functions virtualization security issues have shown to be a barrier to widespread adoption among telecom companies. The following are some dangers associated with implementing network function virtualization that service providers should take into account:\n\n- **Physical security measures do not work:** Comparing virtualized network components to locked-down physical equipment in a data center enhances their susceptibility to new types of assaults.\n- Malware is difficult to isolate and contain: Malware travels more easily among virtual components running on the same virtual computer than between hardware components that can be isolated or physically separated.\n- **Network activity is less visible:** Because traditional traffic monitoring tools struggle to detect potentially malicious anomalies in network traffic going east-west between virtual machines, NFV necessitates more fine-grained security solutions.\n\n## NFV Architecture:\n\nAn individual proprietary hardware component, such as a router, switch, gateway, firewall, load balancer, or intrusion detection system, performs a specific networking function in a typical network architecture. A virtualized network substitutes software programs that operate on virtual machines for these pieces of hardware to carry out networking operations.\n\nThree components make up an NFV architecture:\n\n- **Centralized virtual network infrastructure:** The foundation of an NFV infrastructure can be either a platform for managing containers or a hypervisor that abstracts the resources for computation, storage, and networking.\n- **Applications:** Software delivers many forms of network functionality by substituting for the hardware elements of a conventional network design (virtualized network functions).\n- **Framework:** To manage the infrastructure and provide network functionality, a framework is required (commonly abbreviated as MANO, meaning Management, Automation, and Network Orchestration).\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-virtualization/?ref=next_article)\n\n[What is Network Virtualization?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-network-virtualization/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/annieahujaweb2020/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[annieahujaweb2020](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/annieahujaweb2020/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [CCNA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/ccna/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n- [CCNA Infrastructure Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/ccna-infrastructure-management/?ref=article_tag)\n- [Technical Scripter 2022](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/technical-scripter-2022/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Network Functions Virtualization\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Network Functions Virtualization\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (NFV) refers to the use of virtual machines in place of physical network appliances.

It allowed the users to communicate to each other through the cellular networks. Then came along the 2G (2nd Generation) which added the functionality of sending SMS (Short Message Service) and introduction of internet access through cellular networks. Then the 3G revolution began in 1998 which drastically improved Internet speeds which allowed for video calls GPS tracking etc. This was followed by 4G which is being widely used by today world. 4G introduced Voice over LTE (VoLTE) which allowed for phone calls through the Internet.\n\nSucceeding the previous generation of 4G mobile network, 5G is offering to have faster speeds of data transfer and also more reliability, but how is 5G actually different from 4G and how technology will change if 5G is introduced.\n\nTo start of 5G is going to be approximately 100-250 times faster than regular 4G connection, i.e., it offer around 10 \u2013 12Gbps compared to 4G\u2019s 10-12Mbps. One of the biggest features of 5G network is its ridiculously negligible latency (the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer). The previous generation had a latency of around 200ms (milliseconds), which is in present day considered to be very fast.\n\n**5G: Possibilities \u2013**\n\nA wireless network having a latency of 1ms can have vast possibilities, we can have real time interaction between two wireless devices. For example, a virtual reality wireless video game or a surgeon controlling a robotic arm from the other side of the earth lag-free or maybe two self driving cars communicating with each other in real time. A 5G network is designed to connect to far more greater devices than a traditional cellular network. This maybe be a very useful feature where Internet of Things is feature.\n\n**Latency:**\n\n> It is the delay in the delivery in the data from the origin of the data to reach its destination node/device.\n\nBecause of these capabilities of 5G of transferring huge amounts of data seamlessly without any delay opens up a whole new world of opportunistic. This will enable billions of devices ranging from wearable and smartphones to devices like robots and self driving car to be able to connect and talk to each other through Internet.This will open up a wide range of opportunities for tech companies in the world.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/5g.jpg)\n\n**Image Source:** [assets.pcmag.com](https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/521522-5g.jpg)\n\n**5G: Future \u2013**\n\nThe race for 5G deployment is led by companies like Qualcomm, Huawei, and Intel. Worldwide commercial launch is expected in 2020. Initial launch and testing has been done by companies like AT&T and Verizon in four U.S cities.\n\n5G\u2019s range is lesser than supported by 4G LTE or 3G networks due to its frequency which makes the waves to travel less distance.Hence more base station (Signal Towers) are needed to be installed for good connectivity, this maybe considered as a disadvantage. Therefore setup of 5G will take time and people cant expect this amazing revolution in the near future.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-power-of-5g-wisdom-wireless-communication/?ref=next_article)\n\n[The Power Of 5G WISDOM Wireless Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-power-of-5g-wisdom-wireless-communication/?ref=next_article)\n\n[R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Raghav%20Ganesh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Raghav Ganesh](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Raghav%20Ganesh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n1\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter 2018](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/technical-scripter-2018/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[5G: The Future Of Wireless Networks?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Wireless technology revolution started in this world around the 80's when the First Generation (1G) of mobile networks was released.

Located in the application layer of the OSI model, FTP is a basic system that helps in transferring files between a client and a server. It is what makes the FTP unique that the system provides a reliable and efficient means of transferring files from one system to another even if they have different file structures and operating systems. Contrary to other protocols such as http that cover hypertexts and web resources in general, ftp is dedicated to the management and the transfer of text, binary, or image files.\n\n## What is File Transfer Protocol?\n\nFTP is a standard communication protocol. There are various other protocols like HTTP which are used to transfer files between computers, but they lack clarity and focus as compared to FTP. Moreover, the systems involved in connection are heterogeneous, i.e. they differ in operating systems, directories, structures, character sets, etc the FTP shields the user from these differences and transfers data efficiently and reliably. FTP can transfer ASCII, EBCDIC, or image files. The ASCII is the default file share format, in this, each character is encoded by NVT ASCII. In ASCII or EBCDIC the destination must be ready to accept files in this mode. The image file format is the default format for transforming binary files.\n\n![File-Transfer-Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240110113246/File-Transfer-Protocol-and-HTTPS-gif-2.gif)\n\nFile Transfer Protocol\n\nThe **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)** is widely used in the application layer of networking. It works at the application layer, ensuring that files are sent and received securely.\n\n## Types of FTP\n\n**There are different ways through which a server and a client do a file transfer using FTP. Some of them are mentioned below:**\n\n- **Anonymous FTP:** Anonymous FTP is enabled on some sites whose files are available for public access. A user can access these files without having any username or password. Instead, the username is set to anonymous, and the password is to the guest by default. Here, user access is very limited. For example, the user can be allowed to copy the files but not to navigate through directories.\n\n- **Password Protected FTP:** This type of FTP is similar to the previous one, but the change in it is the use of username and password.\n\n- **FTP Secure (FTPS):** It is also called as FTP Secure Sockets Layer (FTP SSL). It is a more secure version of FTP data transfer. Whenever FTP connection is established, Transport Layer Security (TLS) is enabled.\n\n- **FTP over Explicit SSL/TLS (FTPES):** FTPES helps by upgrading FTP Connection from port 21 to an encrypted connection.\n\n- **Secure FTP (SFTP):** SFTP is not a FTP Protocol, but it is a subset of Secure Shell Protocol, as it works on port 22.\n\n## What is FTP Useful For?\n\nFTP is especially useful for:\n\n- **Transferring Large Files:** FTP can transfer large files in one shot; thus applicable when hosting websites, backing up servers, or sharing files in large quantities.\n- **Remote File Management:** Files on a remote server can be uploaded, downloaded, deleted, renamed, and copied according to the users\u2019 choices.\n- **Automating File Transfers:** FTP is a great protocol for the execution of file transfers on predefined scripts and employments.\n- **Accessing Public Files:** Anonymous FTP means that everybody irrespective of the identity is allowed to download some files with no permissions needed.\n\n## How to Use FTP?\n\nTo use FTP, follow these steps:\n\n- **Connect to the FTP Server:** One can connect to the server using the address, username and password through an FTP client or a command line interface. Anonymous Information may not need a username and password.\n- **Navigate Directories:** Some commands include ls that is used to list directories and cd that is used to change directories.\n- **Transfer Files:** File transfer may be done by using the commands such as get for downloading files, and put for uploading files.\n- **Manage Files:** Make operations like deletion (Delete), renaming (Rename) as well as copying (Copy) of files.\n- **Close the Connection:** Once file transfer has been accomplished, terminate the connection by giving the bye or quit command.\n\n## How Does FTP Work?\n\nFTP is a client server protocol that has two communication channel, command channel for conversation control and data channel for file content.\n\nHere are steps mentioned in which FTP works:\n\n- A user has to log in to FTP Server first, there may be some servers where you can access to content without login, known as anonymous FTP.\n- Client can start a conversation with server, upon requesting to download a file.\n- The user can start different functions like upload, delete, rename, copy files, etc. on server.\n\nFTP can work on different modes like Active and Passive modes. For more, you can refer to [Difference between Active and Passive FTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-active-and-passive-ftp/).\n\n![Working of FTP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/FTP.jpg)\n\n## Types of Connection in FTP\n\n- Control Connection\n- Data Connection\n\n### **Control Connection**\n\nFor sending control information like user identification, password, commands to change the remote directory, commands to retrieve and store files, etc., FTP makes use of a control connection. The control connection is initiated on port number 21.\n\n### **Data connection**\n\nFor sending the actual file, FTP makes use of a data connection. A data connection is initiated on port number 20.\n\nFTP sends the control information out-of-band as it uses a separate control connection. Some protocols send their request and response header lines and the data in the same TCP connection. For this reason, they are said to send their control information in-band. HTTP and [SMTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/) are such examples.\n\n![FTP-Connections](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240103125657/FTP-Connections-660.png)\n\n## FTP Session\n\nWhen an FTP session is started between a client and a server, the client initiates a control [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) connection with the server side. The client sends control information over this. When the server receives this, it initiates a data connection to the client side. But the control connection remains active throughout the user session. As we know HTTP is stateless . But FTP needs to maintain a state about its user throughout the session.\n\n## FTP Clients\n\nFTP works on a [client-server model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/). The FTP client is a program that runs on the user\u2019s computer to enable the user to talk to and get files from remote computers. It is a set of commands that establishes the connection between two hosts, helps to transfer the files, and then closes the connection.\n\nSome of the commands are:\n\n> get the filename(retrieve the file from the server)\n>\n> get the filename(retrieve multiple files from the server )\n>\n> ls(list files available in the current directory of the server)\n\nThere are also built-in FTP programs, which makes it easier to transfer files and it does not require remembering the commands.\n\n## FTP Data Types\n\nThe data type of a file, which determines how the file is represented overall, is the first piece of information that can be provided about it. The FTP standard specifies the following four categories of data:\n\n- **ASCII:** Describes an ASCII text file in which each line is indicated by the previously mentioned type of end-of-line marker.\n- **EBCDIC:** For files that use IBM\u2019s EBCDIC character set, this type is conceptually identical to ASCII.\n- **Image:** This is the \u201cblack box\u201d mode I described earlier; the file has no formal internal structure and is transferred one byte at a time without any processing.\n- **Local:** Files containing data in logical bytes with a bit count other than eight can be handled by this data type.\n\n## **FTP Replies**\n\nSome of the FTP replies are:\n\n- 200 \u2013 Command okay.\n- 530 \u2013 Not logged in.\n- 331 \u2013 \u00a0User name okay, need a password.\n- 221 \u2013 Service closing control connection.\n- 551 \u2013 Requested action aborted: page type unknown.\n- 502 \u2013 Command not implemented.\n- 503 \u2013 Bad sequence of commands.\n- 504 \u2013 Command not implemented for that parameter.\n\n## Characteristics of FTP\n\n- FTP uses TCP as a transport layer protocol.\n- It is good for simple file transfers, such as during boot time.\n- Errors in the transmission (lost packets, checksum errors) must be handled by the TFTP server.\n- It uses only one connection through well-known port 69.\n- [TFTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-ftp-and-tftp/) uses a simple lock-step protocol (each data packet needs to be acknowledged). Thus the throughput is limited.\n\n## FTP\u2019s Security Issues\n\n- Information could not go across a secure tunnel since FTP was not intended to do so. Thus, encryption is not present. A hacker would not need to struggle with encryption to access or alter data that is usable if they could intercept an FTP transaction.\n- Even with FTP cloud storage, data can still be intercepted and misused if the service provider\u2019s system is attacked.\n- As a result, data sent via FTP is a target for spoofing, sniffing, brute force, and other types of attacks that move somewhat slowly. A hacker might examine an FTP transmission and try to take advantage of any flaws by simply port scanning.\n- The fact that FTP uses clear-text passwords\u2014passwords that haven\u2019t been encrypted\u2014is one of its main security flaws. Put differently, \u201cJerry1992\u201d appears exactly like \u201cJerry1992.\u201d The real password is hidden via an algorithm in more secure protocols. As a result, \u201cJerry1992\u201d might appear as \u201cdj18387saksng8937d9d8d7s6a8d89.\u201d Passwords like this are not secured by FTP, which makes them more easily cracked by malicious actors.\n\n## What is an FTP Port?\n\nFTP operates using two ports:\n\n- **Port 21:** As mentioned earlier this is where the commands are issued.\n- **Port 20:** This is the special port required for data connection where the real transfer of file is made.\n\n## How to Change FTP Port Numbers\n\nTo change the default FTP port numbers, follow these steps:\n\n- **Access Server Configuration:** Connect the control panel of your FTP server well as the FTP server configuration file used.\n- **Modify the Port Number:** Find out the possible port settings from the configuration file. Alter the control port, default port is 21 and that of the data is 20.\n- **Restart the FTP Service:** Finally once you have saved your changes you need to stop and restart the FTP service so that the new port settings can be implemented.\n- **Update Client Settings:** Make certain that all the FTP clients that connect with the server are notified of the new port numbers.\n\n## Advantages of FTP\n\n- File sharing also comes in the category of advantages of FTP in this between two machines files can be shared on the network.\n- Speed is one of the main benefits of FTP.\n- Since we don\u2019t have to finish every operation to obtain the entire file, it is more efficient.\n- Using the username and password, we must log in to the FTP server. As a result, FTP might be considered more secure.\n- We can move the files back and forth via FTP. Let\u2019s say you are the firm manager and you provide information to every employee, and they all reply on the same server.\n\n## Disadvantages of FTP\n\n- File size limit is the drawback of FTP only 2 GB size files can be transferred.\n- More then one receivers are not supported by FTP.\n- FTP does not encrypt the data this is one of the biggest drawbacks of FTP.\n- FTP is unsecured we use login IDs and passwords making it secure but they can be attacked by hackers.\n\n## Difference Between FTP and SFTP\n\n| FTP | SFTP |\n| --- | --- |\n| It stands for File Transfer Protocol. | It stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol. |\n| In FTP, secure channel is not provided to transfer the files between the hosts. | In SFTP, a secure channel is provided to transfer the files between the hosts. |\n| It usually runs on port no-21. | It usually runs on port no-22. |\n| It does not encrypt the data before sending | It encrypted data before sending. |\n| It makes uploading and downloading of files without any security. | It maintains full security of the data by using [SSH keys](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-sshsecure-shell-keys/). |\n\n## FTP Security Challenges\n\nFTP was not designed with security in mind, leading to several vulnerabilities:\n\n- **Lack of Encryption:** This is because data such as usernames and passwords are transmitted without encryption and hence easily vulnerable to different attacks.\n- **Vulnerabilities to Attacks:** FTP transmissions are vulnerable to attacks such as spoofing, sniffing, [brute force](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/brute-force-approach-and-its-pros-and-cons/) , and the likes are slow attacks. They suggested that the data can be intercepted and changed easily by [hackers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-hackers/) .\n- **Clear-Text Passwords:** Unfortunately, FTP client authentication employs non encrypted passwords, which makes them vulnerable to hacking.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFTP is still a powerful and effective method for transferring files between systems and still prevails in cases of transferring large files, and in the course of automated systems. Nevertheless, it does not come with security enhancements making it fairly inadequate for sensitive information exchange. In the case of transfers, safer modes like SFTP or FTPS should be encouraged since they make transfers secure. Hence, despite these drawbacks, FTP remains useful to this day since it is simple and stabilized.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on File Transfer Protocol \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Differentiate between FTP and SFTP?\n\n> FTP is a insecure method and transfers the data in plain text whereas SFTP is a secure method that transfers the data in encrypted text.\n\n### What is passive FTP Connection?\n\n> In passive FTP, the client initiates both the control and data connections to the server.\n\n### What is the default port for FTP?\n\n> The default port for FTP is 21. Default port is used for the control connection when the data transfer is occuring on other ports.\n\n### Name the two modes of FTP data transfer?\n\n> - Active Mode\n> - Passive Mode\n\n### W **hat is the difference between FTP and SFTP?**\n\n> The conventional file transmission protocol is called FTP. It\u2019s a simple method of sharing files via the Internet. An additional degree of security is added to file transfers with SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, an alternative to FTP.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-wi-fi/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Basics of Wi-Fi](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-wi-fi/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n57\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Transport Layer responsibilities\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe transport Layer is the second layer in the TCP/IP model and the fourth layer in the OSI model.

It is an essential component of the email communication process and operates at the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. SMTP is a protocol for transmitting and receiving email messages. In this article, we are going to discuss every point about SMTP.\n\n## **What is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol?**\n\nSMTP is an [application layer protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protocols-application-layer/). The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.\n\n![Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240226095034/SMTP-Gif.gif)\n\nSMTP\n\n## **SMTP Protocol**\n\nThe SMTP model is of two types:\n\n- End-to-End Method\n- Store-and-Forward Method\n\nThe end-to-end model is used to communicate between different organizations whereas the store and forward method is used within an organization. An SMTP client who wants to send the mail will contact the destination\u2019s host SMTP directly, to send the mail to the destination. The SMTP server will keep the mail to itself until it is successfully copied to the receiver\u2019s SMTP.\n\nThe client SMTP is the one that initiates the session so let us call it the client-SMTP and the server SMTP is the one that responds to the session request so let us call it receiver-SMTP. The client-SMTP will start the session and the receiver SMTP will respond to the request.\n\nBefore diving deeper into the **Model of SMTP System**, it\u2019s important to understand how SMTP is leveraged by service providers like **SMTP.com** in the real-world scenario.\n\n[**SMTP.com**](https://pstk.smtp.com/jaxib3caxqnf) is a platform that caters to all your **transaction, email relay and email delivery needs** at a very affordable price. With decades of experience, SMTP.com is regarded as the most trusted sender in the industry by ISPs. SMTP.com had been trusted by over 100,000 customers over the years.\n\n**SMTP.com** is extremely intuitive and easy to set up. It can be integrated seamlessly into your current business system. If you need to migrate from another provider, SMTP.com makes it effortless.\n\n### **Features**\n\n- **Dedicated IP**\n- **Email API:** Integrating SMTP.com with your business can be easy with the email API feature. They have complete API documentation on their website that can help you integrate your business in just 5 minutes.\n- **24\u00d77 Customer Support:** The round-the-clock support is one of the best features of SMTP.com. Support is available both on the website and also for paid customers. 24\u00d77, all human support is available for all customers across all plans. No third party is involved and solutions are provided fast for easy implementation. Online chat support is also available for those who are looking for more information about SMTP.com\n- **High Volume Sending Solutions:** This newly launched feature is great for those businesses who want to send more than **250 million emails a month**. Customized quotations and solutions are available.\n- **Reputation Defender:** This is an add-on feature that helps clean up your email lists. It doesn\u2019t need any integration but actively monitors your lists and provides a report.\n\n### **Pricing**\n\nSMTP.com offers affordable delivery services and caters to all kinds of businesses. Their plans range from **$25 to $500 and above**. The best part about this platform is that all the features are available in all the plans. The prices change only based on the volume of emails sent monthly. Even with the lowest price pack, users can get access to **24\u00d77 customer support** and all the SMTP tools. The Reputation Defender for list cleaning is an add-on feature available for all users.\n\n## **Model of SMTP System**\n\nIn the SMTP model user deals with the user agent (UA), for example, Microsoft Outlook, Netscape, Mozilla, etc. To exchange the mail using [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-ip-model/), MTA is used. The user sending the mail doesn\u2019t have to deal with MTA as it is the responsibility of the system admin to set up a local MTA. The MTA maintains a small queue of mail so that it can schedule repeat delivery of mail in case the receiver is not available. The MTA delivers the mail to the mailboxes and the information can later be downloaded by the user agents.\n\n![SMTP Model](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2017/02/SMTP_1.png)\n\nSMTP Model\n\n## Components of SMTP\n\n- **Mail User Agent (MUA):** It is a computer application that helps you in sending and retrieving mail. It is responsible for creating email messages for transfer to the [mail transfer agent(MTA).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/7-best-mail-transfer-agents-mtas-for-linux/)\n- **Mail Submission Agent (MSA):** It is a computer program that receives mail from a Mail User Agent(MUA) and interacts with the Mail Transfer Agent(MTA) for the transfer of the mail.\n- **Mail Transfer Agent (MTA):** It is software that has the work to transfer mail from one system to another with the help of SMTP.\n- **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA):** A mail Delivery agent or Local Delivery Agent is basically a system that helps in the delivery of mail to the local system.\n\n## How does SMTP Work?\n\n- **Communication between the sender and the receiver:**\u00a0The sender\u2019s user agent prepares the message and sends it to the MTA. The MTA\u2019s responsibility is to transfer the mail across the network to the receiver\u2019s MTA. To send mail, a system must have a client MTA, and to receive mail, a system must have a server MTA.\n- **Sending Emails:**\u00a0Mail is sent by a series of request and response messages between the [client and the server](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model). The message which is sent across consists of a header and a body. A null line is used to terminate the mail header and everything after the null line is considered the body of the message, which is a sequence of [ASCII](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ascii-table/) characters. The message body contains the actual information read by the receipt.\n- **Receiving Emails:**\u00a0The user agent on the server-side checks the mailboxes at a particular time of intervals. If any information is received, it informs the user about the mail. When the user tries to read the mail it displays a list of emails with a short description of each mail in the mailbox. By selecting any of the mail users can view its contents on the terminal.\n\n![Working of SMTP](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20220222170044/DV.jpg)\n\nWorking of SMTP\n\n## What is an SMTP Envelope?\n\n- **Purpose**\n  - The SMTP envelope contains information that\u00a0guides email delivery\u00a0between servers.\n  - It is\u00a0distinct from the email headers and body\u00a0and is\u00a0not visible to the email recipient.\n- **Contents of the SMTP Envelope**\n  - **Sender Address**: Specifies where the email originates.\n  - **Recipient Addresses**: Indicates where the email should be delivered.\n  - **Routing Information**: Helps servers determine the path for email delivery.\n- **Comparison to Regular Mail**\n  - Think of the SMTP envelope as the\u00a0**address on a physical envelope**\u00a0for regular mail.\n  - Just like an envelope guides postal delivery, the SMTP envelope directs email servers on where to send the email.\n\n## What are SMTP Commands?\n\n| S.No. | Keywor | Command form | Description | Usage |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | HELO | HELO<SP><domain><CRLF> | It provides the identification of the sender i.e. the host name. | Mandatory |\n| 2. | MAIL | MAIL<SP>FROM : <reverse-path><CRLF> | It specifies the originator of the mail. | Mandatory |\n| 3. | RCPT | RCPT<SP>TO : <forward-path><CRLF> | It specifies the recipient of mail. | Mandatory |\n| 4. | DATA | DATA<CRLF> | It specifies the beginning of the mail. | Mandatory |\n| 5. | QUIT | QUIT<CRLF> | It closes the TCP connection. | Mandatory |\n| 6. | RSET | RSET<CRLF> | It aborts the current mail transaction but the TCP connection remains open. | Highly recommended |\n| 7. | VRFY | VRFY<SP><string><CRLF> | It is use to confirm or verify the user name. | Highly recommended |\n| 8. | NOOP | NOOP<CRLF> | No operation | Highly recommended |\n| 9. | TURN | TURN<CRLF> | It reverses the role of sender and receiver. | Seldom used |\n| 10. | EXPN | EXPN<SP><string><CRLF> | It specifies the mailing list to be expanded. | Seldom used |\n| 11. | HELP | HELP<SP><string><CRLF> | It send some specific documentation to the system. | Seldom used |\n| 12. | SEND | SEND<SP>FROM : <reverse-path><CRLF> | It send mail to the terminal. | Seldom used |\n| 13. | SOML | SOML<SP>FROM : <reverse-path><CRLF> | It send mail to the terminal if possible; otherwise to mailbox. | Seldom used |\n| 14. | SAML | SAML<SP>FROM : <reverse-path><CRLF> | It send mail to the terminal and mailbox. | Seldom used |\n\n## What port does SMTP use?\n\nThe\u00a0**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**\u00a0commonly uses\u00a0**port 587**\u00a0for\u00a0**secure transmission**\u00a0via\u00a0[**TLS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transport-layer-security-tls/). While\u00a0**port 465**\u00a0was previously supported by many providers, it is no longer an accepted standard. Additionally,\u00a0**port 25**\u00a0is mainly used for\u00a0**SMTP relay**, not for SMTP submission.\u00a0Although\u00a0**port 2525**\u00a0is not an official SMTP port, it can serve as a good alternative\n\n## Difference Between SMTP and Extended SMTP\n\n| **SMTP** | **Extended SMTP** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Users were not verified in SMTP as a result of massive-scale scam emails being sent. | In [Extended SMTP,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-esmtp-extended-simple-mail-transfer-protocol/) authentication of the sender is done. |\n| We cannot attach a Multimedia file in SMTP directly without the help of MMIE. | We can directly attach Multimedia FIle in ESMTP. |\n| We cannot reduce the size of the email in SMTP. | We can reduce the size of the email in Extended SMTP. |\n| SMTP clients open transmission with the command HELO. | The main identification feature for ESMTP clients is to open a transmission with the command EHLO (Extended HELLO). |\n\n## **Advantages of SMTP**\n\n- If necessary, the users can have a dedicated server.\n- It allows for bulk mailing.\n- Low cost and wide coverage area.\n- Offer choices for email tracking.\n- Reliable and prompt email delivery.\n\n## **Disadvantages of SMTP**\n\n- SMTP\u2019s common port can be blocked by several [firewalls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network).\n- SMTP security is a bigger problem.\n- Its simplicity restricts how useful it can be.\n- Just 7-bit ASCII characters can be used.\n- If a message is longer than a certain length, SMTP servers may reject the entire message.\n- Delivering your message will typically involve additional back-and-forth processing between servers, which will delay sending and raise the likelihood that it won\u2019t be sent.\n\n## SMTP vs POP vs IMAP\n\n| SMTP | POP | IMAP |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stands for Simple mail transfer protocol | Stands for [Post Office Protocol.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pop-full-form/) | Stands for [Internet Message Access Protocol.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-message-access-protocol-imap/) |\n| Used for sending mail. | Used for retrieving mail. | Used for retrieving mail. |\n| it is push\u00a0[protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-protocols/). | it is pull protocol. | it is pull protocol. |\n| It work between sender\u2019s mail server to receiver\u2019s mail server and sender and sender\u2019s mail server. | It work between receiver and receiver\u2019s mail server. | It works between receiver and receiver\u2019s mail server. |\n| It does not store mail on server it just send the mail. | It download all the mail when it connected to internet. | It store all mail on server and download when it get request to download. |\n| Works on TCP port number 25. | Works on TCP port number 110. | Works on TCP port number 143. |\n| Connection oriented protocol. | Connection oriented protocol. | Connection oriented protocol. |\n| It has persistence TCP connection. | It has persistence TCP connection. | It has persistence TCP connection. |\n| [Stateless](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-stateless-and-stateful-protocol/)\u00a0protocol. | Stateful protocol. | Stateful protocol. |\n| It is in band protocol. | It is in band protocol. | It is in band protocol. |\n| Not used at receiver side. | Used at receiver side. | Used at receiver side. |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSMTP is a fundamental part of email communication that allows messages to be reliably transmitted between email servers. Despite its drawbacks, such as security problems and the possibility of spam, SMTP is still widely used due to its simplicity, efficiency, and broad support across various email systems. Enhancements such as [encryption](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-encryption/) and authentication may solve some of its security issues, making it an appropriate choice for email delivery in a variety of applications.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on SMTP \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the default port for SMTP?\n\n> The default port for Simple mail Transfer Protocol is port 25.\n\n### What is SMTP Relay?\n\n> SMTP Relay can be basically defined as the process of transferring emails from one server to another server.\n\n### Describe some common issues in SMTP Email Delivery.\n\n> Some common issues that appeared in SMTP Email Delivery is Blocked Ports, Authrntication Problem, etc.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction to TELNET](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-telnet/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n128\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [Spotlight](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/spotlight/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a set of rules that explains how different computer systems communicate over a network.

It operates within the application layer of the Internet protocol suite and allows network administrators to manage network performance, find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth.In this article we will see SNMP protocol in detail.\n\n## What is Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)?\n\n**Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**\u00a0is an Internet Standard protocol used for managing and monitoring network-connected devices in IP networks. SNMP is an [application layer protocol](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protocols-application-layer/) that uses UDP port number 161/162. SNMP is used to monitor the network, detect network faults, and sometimes even to configure remote devices.\n\n## Architecture of SNMP\n\nThere are mainly three main components in SNMP architecture:\n\n- **SNMP Manager:** It is a centralized system used to monitor the network. It is also known as a Network Management Station (NMS). A [router](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/) that runs the SNMP server program is called an agent, while a host that runs the SNMP client program is called a manager.\n- **SNMP agent:** It is a software management software module installed on a managed device.\u00a0The manager accesses the values stored in the database, whereas the agent maintains the information in the database. To ascertain if the router is congested or not, for instance, a manager can examine the relevant variables that a router stores, such as the quantity of packets received and transmitted.\n- **Management Information Base:** [MIB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snmp-in-wireshark/) consists of information on resources that are to be managed. This information is organized hierarchically. It consists of objects instances which are essentially variables.\u00a0A MIB, or collection of all the objects under management by the manager, is unique to each agent. System, interface, address translation, IP, [UDP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-datagram-protocol-udp/) , and EGP , [ICMP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/) , [TCP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-transmission-control-protocol-tcp/) are the eight categories that make up MIB. The MIB object is home to these groups.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220907123817/snmpenumeration.jpg)\n\n## **SNMP Messages**\n\n- **GetRequest** : It is simply used to retrieve data from SNMP agents. In response to this, the SNMP agent responds with the requested value through a response message.\n- **GetNextRequest :** To get the value of a variable, the manager sends the agent the GetNextRequest message. The values of the entries in a table are retrieved using this kind of communication. The manager won\u2019t be able to access the values if it doesn\u2019t know the entries\u2019 indices. The GetNextRequest message is used to define an object in certain circumstances.\n- **SetRequest :** It is used by the SNMP manager to set the value of an object instance on the SNMP agent.\n- **Response :** When sent in response to the Set message, it will contain the newly set value as confirmation that the value has been set.\n- **Trap :** These are the message sent by the agent without being requested by the manager. It is sent when a fault has occurred.\n- **InformRequest :** It was added to SNMPv2c and is used to determine if the manager has received the trap message or not. It is the same as a trap but adds an acknowledgement that the trap doesn\u2019t provide.\n\n## **SNMP Security Levels**\n\n- **noAuthNoPriv:** This (no authentication, no privacy) security level uses a community string for authentication and no encryption for privacy.\n- **authNopriv:** This security level ( [authentication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-authentication-and-authorization/) , no privacy) uses HMAC with Md5 for authentication and no encryption is used for privacy.\n- **authPriv:** This security level (authentication, privacy) uses [HMAC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hmachash-based-message-authentication-code/) with [MD5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-md5-algorithm/) or SHA for authentication and encryption uses the DES-56 algorithm.\n\n## Versions of SNMP\n\n- **SNMPv1:** It uses community strings for authentication and uses UDP only.\u00a0SNMPv1 is the first version of the protocol. It is described in RFCs 1155 and 1157 and is simple to set up.\n- **SNMPv2c:** It uses community strings for authentication. It uses UDP but can be configured to use TCP.\u00a0Improved MIB structure elements, transport mappings, and protocol packet types are all included in this updated version. However, it also makes use of the current \u201ccommunity-based\u201d SNMPv1 administrative structure, which is why the version is called SNMPv2c. RFC 1901, RFC 1905, and RFC 1906 all describe it.\n- **SNMPv3:** It uses Hash-based MAC with [MD5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-md5-algorithm/) or [SHA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sha-1-hash-in-java/) for authentication and DES-56 for privacy. This version uses TCP. Therefore, the conclusion is the higher the version of SNMP, the more secure it will be.\u00a0NMPv3 provides the remote configuration of SNMP entities. This is the most secure version to date because it also includes authentication and encryption, which may be used alone or in combination. RFC 1905, RFC 1906, RFC 2571, RFC 2572, RFC 2574, and RFC 2575.6 are the RFCs for SNMPv3.\n\n## **Characteristics of SNMP**\n\n- SNMP is used to monitor network.\n- It detects any network faults.\n- It can also be used to configure remote devices.\n- It allows a standardized way of collecting information about all kinds of devices from various manufacturers among the networking industry.\n\n## Advantages of SNMP\n\n- It is easy to implement.\n- Agents are widely implemented.\n- Agent level overhead is minimal.\n- It is robust and extensible.\n- Polling approach is good for [LAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/) based managed object.\n- It offers the best direct manager agent interface.\n\n## Limitation of SNMP\n\n- It does not scale well.\n- There is no object orietned data view.\n- It has no standard control definition.\n- It has many implementation specific (private MIB) extensions.\n- It has high communication overhead due to polling\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an important protocol for managing and monitoring network-connected devices in [IP networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-ip-address/). It enables administrators to effectively monitor network performance, discover and address errors, and configure remote devices. While SNMP\u2019s simplicity and popularity provide significant advantages, it also has drawbacks, such as scalability concerns and high communication costs. Despite its drawbacks, SNMP remains an important in network management.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on SNMP \u2013 FAQ\u2019s\n\n### What are SNMP agents?\n\n> It is a software module installed on a managed device. Managed devices can be network devices like PC, [routers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/), [switches](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-switches-in-computer-network/), servers, etc.\n\n### What are SNMP MIBS?\n\n> MIB consists of information on resources that are to be managed.. This information is organized hierarchically. It consists of objects instances which are essentially variables.\n\n### Is SNMP provide security?\n\n> SNMP provide security , to secure the communication between users it provide encryption technique and authentication between agents.\n\n### What is the purpose of SNMP traps?\n\n> SNMP traps are the message sent by the agent without being requested by the manager.
