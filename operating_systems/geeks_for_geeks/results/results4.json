Here are a few and important one\u2019s:\n\n1. **leave** \u2014 remind you when you have to leave\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\n    leave +hhmm\n```\n\n\n    leave waits until the specified time (within the next 12 hours), then reminds you that you have to leave by writing to the TTY that you executed leave on. You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.\n\n**Options:** **hhmm** The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and mm are minutes.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-37-22.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-37-22.png)\n\n2. **[diff](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diff-command-linux-examples/)** \u2013 compare files line by line\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\ndiff file1 file2\n```\n\n\n    Compare FILES line by line.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-46-51.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-46-51.png)\n\n\n```\ndiff -q file1 file2\n```\n\n\n    report only when files differ\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-47-25.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-47-25.png)\n\n3. **[cal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cal-command-in-linux-with-examples/), ncal** \u2014 displays a calendar and the date of Easter\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\ncal\n```\n\n\n    The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter. The new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25\u00d780 terminal. If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-58-45.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-58-45.png)\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-59-07.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-17-59-07.png)\n\n4. **[locate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/locate-command-in-linux-with-examples/)** \u2013 find files by name\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\nlocate file_name\n```\n\n\n    locate reads one or more databases prepared by updatedb(8) and writes file names matching at least one of the PATTERNs to standard output, one per line.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-18-21-29.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-18-21-29.png)\n\n5. **[passwd](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/passwd-command-in-linux-with-examples/)** \u2013 change user password\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\npasswd\n```\n\n\n    The passwd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user may only change the password for his/her own account, while the superuser may change the password for any account. passwd also changes the account or associated password validity period.\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-18-26-22.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-18-26-22.png)\n\n6. **[ln](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ln-command-in-linux-with-examples/)** \u2013 make links between files\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n\n\n```\nln existing_file_name file2_name\n```\n\n\n    create a link to TARGET with the name specified\n\n[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-19-22-43.png)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2017-06-05-19-22-43.png)\n\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-locate-which-and-find-command-in-linux/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Difference between locate, which and find Command in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-locate-which-and-find-command-in-linux/?ref=next_article)\n\nM\n\nMayank Kumar\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n12\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Linux-Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linux-unix/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [linux-command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/linux-command/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Important Linux Commands (leave, diff, cal, ncal, locate and ln)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLinux provides some important tricks.

A set of processes combined together make a complete program. There are two categories of processes in Unix, namely\n\n- **User processes** : They are operated in user mode.\n- **Kernel processes** : They are operated in kernel mode.\n\n**Process States**\n\nThe lifetime of a process can be divided into a set of states, each with certain characteristics that describe the process. It is essential to understand the following states now:\n\n1\\. The process is currently executing in user mode.\n\n2\\. The process is currently executing in kernel mode.\n\n3\\. The process is not executing, but it is ready to run as soon as the scheduler chooses it. Many processes may be in this state, and the scheduling algorithm determines which one will execute next.\n\n4\\. The process is sleeping. A process puts itself to sleep when it can no longer\n\ncontinue executing, such as when it is waiting for 1/0 to complete.\n\n5.The process is ready to run, but the swapper(process 0) must swap the process into main memory before the kernel can schedule it to execute.\n\n6.The process is sleeping, and the swapper has swapped the process to secondary storage to make room for other processes in main memory.\n\n7\\. The process is returning from the kernel to user mode, but the kernel preempts it and does a context switch to schedule another process. The distinction between this state and state 3(\u201cready to run\u201d) will be brought out shortly.\n\n8\\. The process is newly created and is in a transition state; the process exists, but it is not ready to run, nor is it sleeping. This state is the start state for all processes except process 0.\n\n9\\. The process executed the exit system call and is in the zombie state. The process no longer exists, but it leaves a record containing an exit code and some timing statistics for its parent process to collect. The zombie state i. the final state of a process.\n\nBecause a processor can execute only one process at a time, at most one process\n\nmay be in states 1 and 2. The two states correspond to the two modes of execution,\n\nuser and kernel.\n\nThe states that a Process enters in working from start till end are known as Process states. These are listed below as:\n\n- **Created** -Process is newly created by system call, is not ready to run\n- **User running** -Process is running in user mode which means it is a user process.\n- **Kernel Running** -Indicates process is a kernel process running in kernel mode.\n- **Zombie-** Process does not exist/ is terminated.\n- **Preempted-** When process runs from kernel to user mode, it is said to be preempted.\n- **Ready to run in memory-** It indicated that process has reached a state where it is ready to run in memory and is waiting for kernel to schedule it.\n- **Ready to run, swapped** \u2013 Process is ready to run but no empty main memory is present\n- **Sleep, swapped-** Process has been swapped to secondary storage and is at a blocked state.\n- **Asleep in memory-** Process is in memory(not swapped to secondary storage) but is in blocked state.\n\n![Process transitions](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/transitions.jpg)\n\nThe numbers indicate the steps that are followed.\n\n### Process Transitions\n\nThe working of Process is explained in following steps:\n\n1. **User-running:** Process is in user-running.\n2. **Kernel-running:** Process is allocated to kernel and hence, is in kernel mode.\n3. **Ready to run in memory:** Further, after processing in main memory process is rescheduled to the Kernel.i.e.The process is not executing but is ready to run as soon as the kernel schedules it.\n4. **Asleep in memory:** Process is sleeping but resides in main memory. It is waiting for the task to begin.\n5. **Ready to run, swapped:** Process is ready to run and be swapped by the processor into main memory, thereby allowing kernel to schedule it for execution.\n6. **Sleep, Swapped:** Process is in sleep state in secondary memory, making space for execution of other processes in main memory. It may resume once the task is fulfilled.\n7. **Pre-empted:** Kernel preempts an on-going process for allocation of another process, while the first process is moving from kernel to user mode.\n8. **Created:** Process is newly created but not running. This is the start state for all processes.\n9. **Zombie:** Process has been executed thoroughly and exit call has been enabled. The process, thereby, no longer exists. But, it stores a statistical record for the process. This is the final state of all processes.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-firewall/?ref=next_article)\n\n[LINUX Firewall](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-firewall/?ref=next_article)\n\n[N](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/NiharikaPandit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[NiharikaPandit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/NiharikaPandit/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n16\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Advanced Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/advanced-data-structure/?ref=article_category)\n- [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/algorithm/?ref=article_category)\n- [Aptitude](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/aptitude-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n- [DSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/?ref=article_category)\n- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/algorithm/dynamic-programming/?ref=article_category)\n- [Experiences](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/experiences/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-science-quizzes-gq/gate-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [GeeksforGeeks Initiatives](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/geeksforgeeks-initiatives/?ref=article_category)\n- [Internship](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/experiences/interview-experiences/internship-interview-experiences/?ref=article_category)\n- [Java Quiz](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-science-quizzes-gq/java-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-science-quizzes-gq/operating-systems-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [Reasoning - Placements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/placements-gq/reasoning-placements-gq/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-programming/?ref=article_category)\n- [Software Engineering](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/software-engineering/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n- [Theory of Computation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-science-quizzes-gq/theory-of-computation-quizzes-gq/?ref=article_category)\n\n+14 More\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Advanced Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Advanced%20Data%20Structure&ref=article_practice_tag)\n- [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Algorithms&ref=article_practice_tag)\n- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Dynamic%20Programming&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Linux/Unix Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLinux is a widely-used open-source operating system, similar to Windows, Mac, and Android.

While running Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or any other Linux distribution, we are interacting with the shell by using the terminal. In this article we will discuss Linux shells and shell scripting so before understanding shell scripting we have to get familiar with the following terminologies:\n\n- Kernel\n- Shell\n- Terminal\n\nTable of Content\n\n- [What is Kernel?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#what-is-kernel)\n- [What is Shell?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#what-is-shell)\n- [Command Line Shell](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#command-line-shell)\n- [Graphical Shells](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#graphical-shells)\n- [What is a terminal?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#what-is-a-terminal)\n- [Shell Scripting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/#shell-scripting)\n\n## **What is Kernel?**\n\nThe kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer\u2019s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. It manages the following resources of the Linux system \u2013\n\n- File management\n- Process management\n- I/O management\n- Memory management\n- Device management etc.\n\nIt is often mistaken that Linus Torvalds has developed Linux OS, but actually, he is only responsible for the development of the Linux kernel.\n\nComplete Linux system = Kernel + GNUsystem utilities and libraries + other management scripts + installation scripts.\n\n## **What is Shell?**\n\nA shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.\n\n![Linux Shell](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/18834419_1198504446945937_35839918_n-300x291.png)\n\nLinux Shell\n\nShell is broadly classified into two categories \u2013\n\n- Command Line Shell\n- Graphical shell\n\n## **Command Line Shell**\n\nShell can be accessed by users using a command line interface. A special program called Terminal in Linux/macOS, or Command Prompt in Windows OS is provided to type in the human-readable commands such as \u201ccat\u201d, \u201cls\u201d etc. and then it is being executed. The result is then displayed on the terminal to the user. A terminal in Ubuntu 16.4 system looks like this \u2013\n\n![linux command line](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cli_example.png)\n\nlinux command line\n\nIn the above screenshot \u201c **ls**\u201d command with \u201c **-l**\u201d option is executed. It will list all the files in the current working directory in a long listing format.\n\nWorking with a command line shell is a bit difficult for beginners because it\u2019s hard to memorize so many commands. It is very powerful; it allows users to store commands in a file and execute them together. This way any repetitive task can be easily automated. These files are usually called batch files in Windows and **Shell** Scripts in Linux/macOS systems.\n\n## **Graphical Shells**\n\nGraphical shells provide means for manipulating programs based on the graphical user interface (GUI), by allowing for operations such as opening, closing, moving, and resizing windows, as well as switching focus between windows. Window OS or Ubuntu OS can be considered as a good example which provides GUI to the user for interacting with the program. Users do not need to type in commands for every action. A typical GUI in the Ubuntu system \u2013\n\n![GUI Shell](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/GUI-shell.png)\n\nGUI Shell\n\nThere are several shells are available for Linux systems like \u2013\n\n- BASH (Bourne Again SHell) \u2013 It is the most widely used shell in Linux systems. It is used as default login shell in Linux systems and in macOS. It can also be installed on Windows OS.\n- CSH (C SHell) \u2013 The C shell\u2019s syntax and its usage are very similar to the C programming language.\n- KSH (Korn SHell) \u2013 The Korn Shell was also the base for the POSIX Shell standard specifications etc.\n\nEach shell does the same job but understands different commands and provides different built-in functions.\n\n## What is a terminal?\n\nA program which is responsible for providing an interface to a user so that he/she can access the shell. It basically allows users to enter commands and see the output of those commands in a text-based interface. Large scripts that are written to automate and perform complex tasks are executed in the terminal.\n\nTo access the terminal, simply search in search box \u201cterminal\u201d and double-click it.\n\n![open terminal](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230426165303/88.webp)\n\nopen terminal\n\nHere you can see how the terminal looks of Red Hat Linux.\n\n![terminal](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230426165604/89.webp)\n\nterminal\n\n## **Shell Scripting**\n\nUsually, shells are interactive, which means they accept commands as input from users and execute them. However, sometimes we want to execute a bunch of commands routinely, so we have to type in all commands each time in the terminal.\n\nAs a shell can also take commands as input from file, we can write these commands in a file and can execute them in shell to avoid this repetitive work. These files are called **Shell Scripts** or **Shell Programs**. Shell scripts are similar to the batch file in MS-DOS. Each shell script is saved with **\\`.sh\\`** file extension e.g., **myscript.sh.**\n\nA shell script has syntax just like any other programming language. If you have any prior experience with any programming language like Python, C/C++ etc. It would be very easy to get started with it.\n\nA shell script comprises the following elements \u2013\n\n- Shell Keywords \u2013 if, else, break etc.\n- Shell commands \u2013 cd, ls, echo, pwd, touch etc.\n- Functions\n- Control flow \u2013 if..then..else, case and shell loops etc.\n\n### **Why do we need shell scripts?**\n\nThere are many reasons to write shell scripts:\n\n- To avoid repetitive work and automation\n- System admins use shell scripting for routine backups.\n- System monitoring\n- Adding new functionality to the shell etc.\n\n### **Some Advantages of shell scripts**\n\n- The command and syntax are exactly the same as those directly entered in the command line, so programmers do not need to switch to entirely different syntax\n- Writing shell scripts are much quicker\n- Quick start\n- Interactive debugging etc.\n\n### **Some Disadvantages of shell scripts**\n\n- Prone to costly errors, a single mistake can change the command which might be harmful.\n- Slow execution speed\n- Design flaws within the language syntax or implementation\n- Not well suited for large and complex task\n- Provide minimal data structure unlike other scripting languages. etc.\n\n#### **Simple demo of shell scripting using Bash Shell**\n\nIf you work on a terminal, something you traverse deep down in directories. Then for coming few directories up in path we have to execute a command like this as shown below to get to the \u201cpython\u201d directory:\n\n![get to the \u201cpython\u201d directory:](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/old_way_cd.png)\n\nget to the \u201cpython\u201d directory:\n\nIt is quite frustrating, so why not we can have a utility where we just have to type the name of directory and we can directly jump to that without executing the \u201c **cd ../**\u201d command again and again. Save the script as \u201c **jump.sh**\u201d\n\nbash`\n# !/bin/bash\n# A simple bash script to move up to desired directory level directly\nfunction jump()\n{\n    # original value of Internal Field Separator\n    OLDIFS=$IFS\n    # setting field separator to \"/\"\n    IFS=/\n    # converting working path into array of directories in path\n    # eg. /my/path/is/like/this\n    # into [, my, path, is, like, this]\n    path_arr=($PWD)\n    # setting IFS to original value\n    IFS=$OLDIFS\n    local pos=-1\n    # ${path_arr[@]} gives all the values in path_arr\n    for dir in \"${path_arr[@]}\"\n    do\n        # find the number of directories to move up to\n        # reach at target directory\n        pos=$[$pos+1]\n        if [ \"$1\" = \"$dir\" ];then\n            # length of the path_arr\n            dir_in_path=${#path_arr[@]}\n            #current working directory\n            cwd=$PWD\n            limit=$[$dir_in_path-$pos-1]\n            for ((i=0; i<limit; i++))\n            do\n                cwd=$cwd/..\n            done\n            cd $cwd\n            break\n        fi\n    done\n}\n`\n\nFor now, we cannot execute our shell script because it does not have permissions. We have to make it executable by typing following command \u2013\n\n> $ chmod +x path/to/our/file/jump.sh\n\nNow to make this available on every terminal session, we have to put this in \u201c **.bashrc**\u201d file.\n\n\u201c **.bashrc**\u201d is a shell script that Bash shell runs whenever it is started interactively. The purpose of a .bashrc file is to provide a place where you can set up variables, functions, and aliases, define our prompt, and define other settings that we want to use whenever we open a new terminal window.\n\nNow open the terminal and type the following command:\n\n> $ echo \u201csource ~/path/to/our/file/jump.sh\u201d>> ~/.bashrc\n\nNow open your terminal and try out new \u201cjump\u201d functionality by typing following command-\n\n> $ jump dir\\_name\n\njust like the below screenshot:\n\n![jump dir_name](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/jump_way_cd-1.png)\n\njump dir\\_name\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned about the essential parts of Linux systems: the kernel, which controls everything, the shell, which lets us interact with the operating system, and the terminal, our interface to give commands. We explored command line and graphical shells, like BASH, and understood that the terminal is where we type in our commands. The article introduced shell scripting, a way to automate tasks using simple scripts, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using them. A practical example demonstrated creating a script for quick directory navigation. Finally, we saw how to make the script work and become accessible in every terminal session. This article is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding and using Linux shells and shell scripting.linux is good language it is written in linux language\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-shell-script-in-linux/?ref=next_article)\n\n[How to Create a Shell Script in linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-shell-script-in-linux/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n150\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Linux-Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linux-unix/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Introduction to Linux Shell and Shell Scripting\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIf we are using any major operating system, we are indirectly interacting with the shell.

The **\u2018Crontab\u2019 Command on Linux** works in the system\u2019s background.\n\nThe **\u2018Crontab\u2019 Linux Command** goes on to check the time on the device and when a particular time arrives, it performs pre-defined tasks automatically. This article will share all the nitty-gritty details related to the **\u2018Crontab\u2019 in Linux with Examples**.\n\nTable of Content\n\n- [What is Linux Crontab?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples/#what-is-linux-crontab)\n- [How crontab Works?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples/#how-crontab-works)\n- [Usage and Examples of Cron jobs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples/#usage-and-examples-of-cron-jobs)\n- [Features of Crontab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples/#features-of-crontab)\n\n## **What is Linux Crontab?**\n\n[Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-linux-shell-shell-scripting/) Crontab is a powerful utility that is used for **Scheduling and Automating Tasks** in [Unix-like operating systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-tutorial/). It facilitates the users to run the scripts or [Linux Commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-commands/) at specified times and intervals. It is ideal for repetitive tasks such as system maintenance, backups, and updates.\n\nEach user can have their [Crontab](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/crontab-in-linux-with-examples/) file, where they can define the scheduling commands that are to be executed. It helps in simplifying the task automation enhancing the system efficiency and reliability. Crontab stands for \u201ccron table, \u201d because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks; cron itself is named after \u201cChronos, \u201d the Greek word for time.\n\n## **What is the Syntax of Linux Crontab?**\n\n- The Linux Crontab Format is represented by the following syntax:\n\n```\nMIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD\n```\n\n- Let\u2019s break down each field and discuss as follows:\n\n| Field | Description | Allowed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **MIN (Minute)** | Specifies the minute when the command will run | It ranges from 0 to 59. |\n| **HOUR** | Denotes the hour of the day when the command is scheduled to execute. | It spans from 0 to 23. |\n| **DOM (Day of Month)** | Specifies the day of the month for the task. | It ranges from 1 to 31. |\n| **MON (Month)** | Indicates the month during which the command will be executed. | It varies from 1 to 12. |\n| **DOW (Day of Week)** | Specifies the day of the week for the task. | It is represented by numbers from 0 to 7, where both 0 and 7 correspond to Sunday. |\n| **CMD (Command)** | Represents the actual command or script that will run at the scheduled time. | \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 |\n\n## How Linux Crontab Works?\n\nCrontab works by allowing the users to schedule tasks or commands that help to run automatically at specified times and intervals. The following are the points that discuss how the crontab will operate:\n\n- **Crontab Configuration**: Each user on a Linux system can maintain their crontab file that facilitates listing the commands or scripts that are to be executed as their schedule.\n- **Time Specification**: It uses a specific syntax for defining when the tasks should run. Its syntax includes the fields for minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week.\n- **Scheduled Execution**: The cron daemon ( `cron`) will continuously check crontab files to determine if any scheduled tasks match the current time. When a match is found, it executes the specified command or script.\n- **Logging and Notifications**: Output from cron jobs is typically mailed to the user\u2019s email by default. Users can redirect output to files or disable email notifications as needed.\n- **System-wide and User-specific**: System administrators can configure system-wide cron jobs in `/etc/crontab` and `/etc/cron.d/`, while individual users manage their tasks using the `crontab -e` command to edit their crontab files.\n\n## **What are Some Usage and Examples of Linux Crontab Jobs?**\n\nThe following are some examples of cron jobs:\n\n### **1\\. Scheduling a Job For a Specific Time:**\n\n- The basic usage of cron is to execute a job in a specific time as shown below. This will execute the Full backup shell script (full-backup) on 10th June at 08:30 AM.\n- The time field uses 24 hours format. So, for 8 AM use 8, and 8 PM use 20.\n\n```\n30 08 10 06 * /home/maverick/full-backup\n\n```\n\n- 30 \u2013 30th Minute 08 \u2013 08 AM 10 \u2013 10th Day 06 \u2013 6th Month (June) \\* \u2013 Every day of the week\n\n### **2\\. To View the Crontab entries:**\n\n- View Current Logged-In User\u2019s Crontab entries: To view your crontab entries type crontab -l from your Unix account. ![viewing the crontab entries](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cron1-1.png)\n- View Root Crontab entries: Login as root user (su \u2013 root) and do crontab -l. ![no cron jobs are listed](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cron2.png)\n- To view crontab entries of other Linux users: Login to root and use -u {username} -l. ![viewing the cronjobs of a user](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cron3.png)\n\n### **3\\. To Edit Crontab Entries** Edit the Current Logged-In User\u2019s Crontab Entries:\n\n- To edit a crontab entries, use crontab -e. By default, this will edit the currently logged-in user crontab. ![editing the crontab entries](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cron4.png)\n\n### **4\\. To Schedule a Job for Every Minute using Cron:**\n\n- Ideally, you may not have a requirement to schedule a job every minute. But understanding this example will help you understand the other examples.\n\n```\n* * * * * CMD\n\n```\n\n- The \\* means all the possible units \u2014 i.e. every minute of every hour throughout the year. More than using this \\* directly, you will find it very useful in the following cases.\n- When you specify \\*/5 in the minute field means every 5 minutes. When you specify 0-10/2 in the minute field means every 2 minutes in the first 10 minutes. Thus the above convention can be used for all the other 4 fields.\n\n### **5\\. To Schedule a Job For More Than One Time (e.g. Twice a Day):**\n\n- The following script takes an incremental backup twice a day every day. This example executes the specified incremental backup shell script (incremental-backup) at 11:00 and 16:00 every day.\n- The comma-separated value in a field specifies that the command needs to be executed at all the mentioned times.\n\n```\n00 11, 16 * * * /home/maverick/bin/incremental-backup\n\n```\n\n- 00 \u2013 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 11, 16 \u2013 11 AM and 4 PM \\* \u2013 Every day \\* \u2013 Every month \\* \u2013 Every day of the week\n\n### **6\\. To Schedule a Job for a** Within **Certain Range of Time (e.g. Only on Weekdays):**\n\nIf you wanted a job to be scheduled for every hour within a specific range of time then use the following.\n\n- Cron Job every day during working hours: This example checks the status of the [database](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-database/) every day (including weekends) during the working hours 9 a.m \u2013 6 p.m\n\n```\n00 09-18 * * * /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status\n\n```\n\n- 00 \u2013 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 09-18 \u2013 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm \\* \u2013 Every day \\* \u2013 Every month \\* \u2013 Every day of the week\n- Cron Job every weekday during working hours: This example checks the status of the database every weekday (i.e. excluding Sat and Sun) during the working hours 9 a.m \u2013 6 p.m.\n\n```\n00 09-18 * * 1-5 /home/maverick/bin/check-db-status\n\n```\n\n- 00 \u2013 0th Minute (Top of the hour) 09-18 \u2013 9 am, 10 am, 11 am, 12 am, 1 pm, 2 pm, 3 pm, 4 pm, 5 pm, 6 pm \\* \u2013 Every day \\* \u2013 Every month 1-5 -Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu and Fri (Every Weekday)\n\n### **7\\. To Schedule a Background Cron Job for Every 10 Minutes:**\n\n- Use the following, if you want to check the disk space every 10 minutes.\n\n```\n*/10 * * * * /home/maverick/check-disk-space\n\n```\n\n- It executes the specified command check-disk-space every 10 minutes throughout the year. But you may have a requirement of executing the command only during certain hours or vice versa.\n- The above examples show how to do those things. Instead of specifying values in the 5 fields, we can specify them using a single keyword as mentioned below.\n- There are special cases in which instead of the above 5 fields you can use @ followed by a keyword \u2014 such as reboot, midnight, yearly, or hourly.\n\n```\nKeyword    Equivalent\n@yearly    0 0 1 1 *\n@daily     0 0 * * *\n@hourly    0 * * * *\n@reboot    Run at startup.\n\n```\n\n### **8\\. To Schedule a Job for the First Minute of Every Year Using @yearly:**\n\n- If you want a job to be executed on the first minute of every year, then you can use the @yearly cron keyword as shown below.\n- This will execute the system annual maintenance using the annual-maintenance shell script at 00:00 on Jan 1st for every year.\n\n```\n@yearly /home/maverick/bin/annual-maintenance\n\n```\n\n### **9\\. To Schedule a Cron Job Beginning of Every Month Using @monthly:**\n\n- It is similar to the @yearly as above. But executes the command monthly once using the @monthly cron keyword. This will execute the shell script tape-backup at 00:00 on the 1st of every month.\n\n```\n@monthly /home/maverick/bin/tape-backup\n\n```\n\n### **10\\. To Schedule a Background Job Every Day Using @daily:**\n\n- Using the @daily cron keyword, this will do a daily log file cleanup using the cleanup-logs shell script at 00:00 every day.\n\n```\n@daily /home/maverick/bin/cleanup-logs \"day started\"\n\n```\n\n### **11\\. To Execute a Command after Every Reboot Using @reboot:**\n\n- Using the @reboot cron keyword, this will execute the specified command once after the machine gets booted every time.\n\n```\n@reboot CMD\n\n```\n\n## What are Some Features of Linux Crontab?\n\nThe following are the features of crontab:\n\n- **Flexible Scheduling**: The Crontab allows users to schedule tasks with a high degree of flexibility, specifying exact times, intervals, days of the week, and months for execution.\n- **Automated Task Execution**: It facilitates with automatic execution of commands or scripts without user intervention, making it ideal for repetitive tasks like backups, updates, and system maintenance.\n- **User-specific Configuration**: Through each user it can maintain their crontab file, allowing personalized scheduling of tasks tailored to individual needs and preferences.\n- **Special Time Indicators**: Offers convenience with predefined time indicators ( `@reboot`, `@daily`, `@weekly`, etc.) for commonly used schedules, simplifying the setup of recurring tasks.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFrom the above extensive discussion, we can conclude that the **\u2018Crontab\u2019 Command on** [**Linux Distributions**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-linux-distributions/) is one of the powerful tools that can be used to **Automate Tasks on Linux**. If you want to perform **System Maintenance, Backups, and Updates** then the **Linux \u2018Crontab\u2019 Command** should be used as we have discussed.\n\n## Linux Crontab Command \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is cron in Linux?**\n\n> Cron is a time-based job scheduler in [Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unix-file-system/)-like operating systems that executes commands or scripts at specified times and intervals.\n\n### **How do I run a cron job every 5 minutes?**\n\n> Use the cron syntax `*/5 * * * * command` to schedule a job to run every 5 minutes.\n\n### **How to check if cron is running?**\n\n> Use the command `systemctl status cron` or `service cron status` to check if the cron service is active.\n\n### **What is a cron job example?**\n\n> An example of a cron job is `0 2 * * * /path/to/backup.sh`, which runs a backup script at 2 AM every day.\n\n### **How do I start and stop a cron job in Linux?**\n\n> To start cron, use `systemctl start cron` or `service cron start`; to stop it, use `systemctl stop cron` or `service cron stop`.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/at-command-in-linux-with-examples/?ref=next_article)\n\n[at Command in Linux with Examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/at-command-in-linux-with-examples/?ref=next_article)\n\nK\n\nKishlay Verma\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n40\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Linux-Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linux-unix/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [TechTips](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/techtips/?ref=article_category)\n- [linux-command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/linux-command/?ref=article_tag)\n- [Linux-misc-commands](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/linux-misc-commands/?ref=article_tag)\n\n+1 More\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Linux Commands\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nLinux commands are essential for controlling and managing the system through the terminal.

It searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence, until the outcome is known (the left-hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name. If no starting-point is specified, \\`.\u2019 is assumed. The find command by default travels down the entire directory tree recursively, which is time and resource consuming. However the depth of directory traversal can be specified(which are\n\n_mindepth_\n\nand\n\n_maxdepth_\n\n).\n\n**What are mindepth and maxdepth levels?**\n\n- **maxdepth levels** : Descend at most levels (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the starting-points. _-maxdepth 0_ means only apply the tests and actions to the starting-points themselves.\n- **mindepth levels** : Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than levels (a non-negative integer). -mindepth 1 means process all files except the starting-points.\n\n**Given below some examples to illustrate how depth of the directory traversal can be specified using**\n\n_**mindepth**_\n\n**and**\n\n_**maxdepth**_\n\n- Find the passwd file under all sub-directories starting from the root directory.\n\n```\nfind / -name passwd\n```\n\n\n\n```\n\n```\n\n- Find the passwd file under root and one level down. (i.e root \u2014 level 1, and one sub-directory \u2014 level 2)\n\n```\nfind / -maxdepth 2 -name passwd\n```\n\n\n\n```\n\n```\n\n- Find the passwd file under root and two levels down. (i.e root \u2014 level 1, and two sub-directories \u2014 level 2 and 3 )\n\n```\nfind / -maxdepth 3 -name passwd\n```\n\n\n\n```\n\n```\n\n- Find the password file between sub-directory level 2 and 4.\n\n```\nfind / -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 5 -name passwd\n```\n\n\n\n```\n\n```\n\n\n**There are two other ways to limit search a directory in linux :**\n\n**grep** Grep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or the file name \u2013 is given) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.By default, grep prints the matching lines.\n\n**Examples of grep :**\n\n```\nYou can search the current directory with grep as follows:\n\nTo check whether a directory exists or not\n\nFind the directory under root directory.\n\nFind the directory under root and one levels down.\n\n```\n\n**ack** Ack is designed as a replacement for 99% of the uses of grep. Ack searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or the file name \u2013 is given) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN. By default, ack prints the matching lines. Ack can also list files that would be searched, without actually searching them, to let you take advantage of ack\u2019s file-type filtering capabilities. Ack does not have a max-depth option\n\n**Examples of ack :**\n\n```\nTo check a particular directory under the root\n\n```\n\n## mindepth and maxdepth in Linux find() command for limiting search to a specific directory. \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What do mindepth and maxdepth do in the find command?\n\n> In the `find` command in Linux, `mindepth` and `maxdepth` are options used to limit the depth of directory traversal:\n>\n> - **mindepth**: Controls how deep `find` starts to report results. If you specify `mindepth` as 2, `find` will ignore everything at depth 1 (the top-level directory) and start reporting from depth 2.\n> - **maxdepth**: Limits how far down in the directory structure `find` will go to look for matches. If you specify `maxdepth` as 1, `find` will only look at the direct children of the directories specified and no further.\n\n### How to use mindepth to limit search results in Linux?\n\n> To use `mindepth` in the `find` command, specify it followed by the minimum depth you want `find` to start reporting results. For example, to find all `.txt` files starting from subdirectories two levels down from the current directory:\n>\n> ```\n> find . -mindepth 2 -name \"*.txt\"\n> ```\n>\n> This command will not report `.txt` files in the current directory or its immediate subdirectories but will start from subdirectories two levels deep.\n\n### How to use maxdepth to limit search results in Linux?\n\n> To use `maxdepth` in the `find` command, specify it followed by the maximum depth you want `find` to search. For example, to find all `.txt` files in the current directory and its immediate subdirectories:\n>\n> ```\n> find . -mindepth 2 -name \"*.txt\"\n> ```\n>\n> This command will look for `.txt` files in the current directory (depth 1) and its immediate subdirectories (depth 2).\n\n### Can mindepth and maxdepth be used together in find?\n\n> Yes, `mindepth` and `maxdepth` can be used together in a single `find` command to finely control the search depth. For example, to find files only in subdirectories exactly two levels deep, you can set both `mindepth` and `maxdepth` to 2:\n>\n> ```\n> find . -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name \"*.txt\"\n> ```\n>\n> This command will only find `.txt` files that are located exactly two directories beneath the current directory.\n\n### What are some examples of using mindepth and maxdepth in real scenarios?\n\n> Here are a couple of practical examples where `mindepth` and `maxdepth` can be particularly useful:\n>\n> **1\\. Backup Scripts**: When creating backups, you might want to exclude the top directory or include only specific subdirectory levels. For instance, backing up only the second-level directories of a project:\n>\n> ```\n> find /project -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d -exec tar -cvzf {}.tar.gz {} \\;\n> ```\n>\n> **2\\. System Administration**: Searching for specific types of files within a controlled depth range for performance reasons, like finding all log files within the first three levels of `/var/log`:\n>\n> ```\n> find /var/log -maxdepth 3 -name \"*.log\"\n> ```\n>\n> **3\\. Cleaning Up Temporary Files**: Removing temporary files that are not within the top-level temporary directories, ensuring that directory structure is preserved:\n>\n> ```\n> find /tmp -mindepth 2 -name \"*.tmp\" -delete\n> ```\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cd-command-in-linux-with-examples/?ref=next_article)\n\n[How to Change the Directory in Linux \\| cd Command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cd-command-in-linux-with-examples/?ref=next_article)\n\nK\n\nKishlay Verma\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n4\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Linux-Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linux-unix/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [linux-command](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/linux-command/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[mindepth and maxdepth in Linux find() command for limiting search to a specific directory.\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nHow to limit search a specified directory in Linux?

For example flight control systems, real-time monitors, etc.\n\n### Types of real-time systems based on timing constraints:\n\n1. **Hard real-time system:** This type of system can never miss its deadline. Missing the deadline may have disastrous consequences. The usefulness of results produced by a hard real-time system decreases abruptly and may become negative if tardiness increases. Tardiness means how late a real-time system completes its task with respect to its deadline. Example: Flight controller system.\n2. **Soft real-time system:**\u00a0This type of system can miss its deadline occasionally with some acceptably low probability. Missing the deadline have no disastrous consequences. The usefulness of results produced by a soft real-time system decreases gradually with an increase in tardiness. Example: Telephone switches.\n3. **Firm Real-Time Systems:** These are systems that lie between hard and soft real-time systems. In firm real-time systems, missing a deadline is tolerable, but the usefulness of the output decreases with time. Examples of firm real-time systems include online trading systems, online auction systems, and reservation systems.\n\n### Reference model of the real-time system:\n\nOur reference model is characterized by three elements:\n\n1. **A workload model:** It specifies the application supported by the system.\n2. **A resource model:** It specifies the resources available to the application.\n3. **Algorithms:** It specifies how the application system will use resources.\n\n### Terms related to real-time system:\n\n01. **Job:** A job is a small piece of work that can be assigned to a processor and may or may not require resources.\n02. **Task:** A set of related jobs that jointly provide some system functionality.\n03. **Release time of a job:** It is the time at which the job becomes ready for execution.\n04. **Execution time of a job:** It is the time taken by the job to finish its execution.\n05. **Deadline of a job:** It is the time by which a job should finish its execution. Deadline is of two types: absolute deadline and relative deadline.\n06. **Response time of a job:** It is the length of time from the release time of a job to the instant when it finishes.\n07. The maximum allowable response time of a job is called its relative deadline.\n08. The absolute deadline of a job is equal to its relative deadline plus its release time.\n09. Processors are also known as active resources. They are essential for the execution of a job. A job must have one or more processors in order to execute and proceed towards completion. Example: computer, transmission links.\n10. Resources are also known as passive resources. A job may or may not require a resource during its execution. Example: memory, mutex\n11. Two resources are identical if they can be used interchangeably else they are heterogeneous.\n\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- Real-time systems provide immediate and accurate responses to external events, making them suitable for critical applications such as air traffic control, medical equipment, and industrial automation.\n- They can automate complex tasks that would otherwise be impossible to perform manually, thus improving productivity and efficiency.\n- Real-time systems can reduce human error by automating tasks that require precision, accuracy, and consistency.\n- They can help to reduce costs by minimizing the need for human intervention and reducing the risk of errors.\n- Real-time systems can be customized to meet specific requirements, making them ideal for a wide range of applications.\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n- Real-time systems can be complex and difficult to design, implement, and test, requiring specialized skills and expertise.\n- They can be expensive to develop, as they require specialized hardware and software components.\n- Real-time systems are typically less flexible than other types of computer systems, as they must adhere to strict timing requirements and cannot be easily modified or adapted to changing circumstances.\n- They can be vulnerable to failures and malfunctions, which can have serious consequences in critical applications.\n- Real-time systems require careful planning and management, as they must be continually monitored and maintained to ensure they operate correctly.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tasks-in-real-time-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Tasks in Real Time systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tasks-in-real-time-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/priyanka%20dahiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[priyanka dahiya](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/priyanka%20dahiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Real Time Systems\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA real-time system means that the system is subjected to real-time, i.e., the response should be guaranteed within a specified timing constraint or the system should meet the specified deadline.

For example flight control systems, real-time monitors, etc.\n\nThere are four types of tasks in real-time systems:\n\n1. Periodic tasks\n2. Dynamic tasks\n3. Critical task\n4. Non-critical task\n\n- **Periodic Tasks:** In periodic tasks, jobs are released at regular intervals. A periodic task is one that repeats itself after a fixed time interval. A periodic task is denoted by four tuples: **T** ****i**** **= < \u03a6** ****i**** **, P** ****i**** **, e** ****i**** **, D** ****i**** **>**\n\nWhere,\n  - **\u03a6** ****i**** \u2013 is the phase of the task. Phase is the release time of the first job in the task. If the phase is not mentioned then the release time of the first job is assumed to be zero.\n  - **P** ****i**** \u2013 is the period of the task i.e. the time interval between the release times of two consecutive jobs.\n  - **e** ****i**** \u2013 is the execution time of the task.\n  - **D** ****i**** \u2013 is the relative deadline of the task.\n\nFor example: Consider the task Ti with period = 5 and execution time = 3\n\nPhase is not given so, assume the release time of the first job as zero. So the job of this task is first released at t = 0 then it executes for 3s and then the next job is released at t = 5 which executes for 3s and then the next job is released at t = 10. So jobs are released at t = 5k where k = 0, 1, . . ., n\n\n![Interval real time](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/real-time.png)\n\nHyper period of a set of periodic tasks is the least common multiple of periods of all the tasks in that set. For example, two tasks T1 and T2 having period 4 and 5 respectively will have a hyper period, H = lcm(p1, p2) = lcm(4, 5) = 20. The hyper period is the time after which pattern of job release times starts to repeat.\n\n- **Dynamic Tasks:** It is a sequential program that is invoked by the occurrence of an event. An event may be generated by the processes external to the system or by processes internal to the system. Dynamically arriving tasks can be categorized on their criticality and knowledge about their occurrence times.\n1. **Aperiodic Tasks:** In this type of task, jobs are released at arbitrary time intervals i.e. randomly. Aperiodic tasks have soft deadlines or no deadlines.\n2. **Sporadic Tasks:** They are similar to aperiodic tasks i.e. they repeat at random instances. The only difference is that sporadic tasks have hard deadlines. A sporadic task is denoted by three tuples: **T** ****i**** **=(e** ****i**** **, g** ****i**** **, D** ****i**** **)**\n\n     Where\n\n     **e** ****i**** \u2013 the execution time of the task.\n\n     **g** ****i**** \u2013 the minimum separation between the occurrence of two consecutive instances of the task.\n\n     **D** ****i**** \u2013 the relative deadline of the task.\n\n- **Critical Tasks:**\n\nCritical Tasks are those whose opportune executions are basic. In the event that cutoff times are missed, calamities happen.\n\nFor instance, life-emotionally supportive networks and the steadiness control of airplane. On the off chance that basic errands are executed at a higher recurrence, it is fundamental.\n\n- **Non-critical Tasks:**\n\nNon-critical Tasks are genuine times assignments. As the name infers, they are not basic to the application. Be that as it may, they can manage time, changing information, and consequently they are futile on the off chance that not finished inside a cutoff time. The objective of booking these assignments is to expand the level of occupations effectively executed inside their cutoff times.\n\n**Jitter:** Sometimes actual release time of a job is not known. Only know that ri is in a range \\[ ri-, ri\\+ \\]. This range is known as release time jitter. Here ri\u2013 is how early a job can be released and ri\\+ is how late a job can be released. Only the range \\[ ei-, ei\\+ \\] of the execution time of a job is known. Here ei\u2013 is the minimum amount of time required by a job to complete its execution and ei\\+ is the maximum amount of time required by a job to complete its execution.\n\n**Precedence Constraint of Jobs:** Jobs in a task are independent if they can be executed in any order. If there is a specific order in which jobs in a task have to be executed then jobs are said to have precedence constraints. For representing precedence constraints of jobs a partial order relation < is used. This is called precedence relation. A job Ji is a predecessor of job Jj if Ji < Jj i.e. Jj cannot begin its execution until Ji completes. Ji is an immediate predecessor of Jj if Ji < Jj and there is no other job Jk such that Ji < Jk < Jj. Ji and Jj are independent if neither Ji < Jj nor Jj < Ji is true.\n\nAn efficient way to represent precedence constraints is by using a directed graph G = (J, <) where J is the set of jobs. This graph is known as the precedence graph. Jobs are represented by vertices of the graph and precedence constraints are represented using directed edges. If there is a directed edge from Ji to Jj then it means that Ji is the immediate predecessor of Jj. For example: Consider a task T having 5 jobs J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5 such that J2 and J5 cannot begin their execution until J1 completes and there are no other constraints.\n\nThe precedence constraints for this example are:\n\nJ1 < J2 and J1 < J5\n\n![Precedence graph](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/real-time1.png)\n\nSet representation of precedence graph:\n\n1. < (1) = { }\n2. < (2) = {1}\n3. < (3) = { }\n4. < (4) = { }\n5. < (5) = {1}\n\nConsider another example where a precedence graph is given and you have to find precedence constraints\n\n![precedence graph another example](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/real-time-2.png)\n\nFrom the above graph, we derive the following precedence constraints:\n\n1. J1 < J2\n2. J2 < J3\n3. J2 < J4\n4. J3 < J4\n\nFAQ:\n\n**What are some common examples of real-time systems?**\n\nIndustries like aviation, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications make use of real-time systems. The employed systems incorporate flight control applications, real-time monitors in healthcare facilities, industrial control systems, and real-time communication systems.\n\n**What is the difference between aperiodic and sporadic tasks?**\n\nTasks that are aperiodic are not released on a regular schedule, whereas sporadic tasks are released at irregular but anticipated intervals. Aperiodic tasks may have lenient or nonexistent deadlines, while sporadic tasks are required to meet strict deadlines.\n\n**What is jitter in real-time systems?**\n\nThe time release or execution of a task can be affected by a fluctuation known as Jitter. This phenomenon can be triggered by multiple factors including network delays, software errors, or hardware limitations. Struggling to manage Jitter can have a tremendous effect on real-time systems, so precise timing control is crucial.\n\n**How are precedence constraints represented in real-time systems?**\n\nPrecedence constraints are represented using a directed graph called a precedence graph. Each job is represented by a vertex, and the precedence constraints are represented by directed edges between vertices. If there is a directed edge from job A to job B, it means that A must complete before B can begin.\n\n**What is the hyper period of a set of periodic tasks?**\n\nThe hyper period of a set of periodic tasks is the least common multiple of their periods. It is the smallest time after which the pattern of job release times for all tasks in the set repeats. The hyper period is an important parameter in real-time scheduling, as it determines the scheduling cycle for the tasks.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[P](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/priyanka%20dahiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[priyanka dahiya](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/priyanka%20dahiya/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n49\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Tasks in Real Time systems\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThe system is subjected to real-time, i.e. response should be guaranteed within a specified timing constraint or system should meet the specified deadline.

Like microkernel, this one also manages system resources between application and hardware, but **user** and **kernel services** are implemented under the same address space. It increases the size of the kernel, thus increasing the size of the operating system as well.\u00a0 This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other operating system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, the operating system execution is faster.\n\n## What is a Monolithic Kernel?\n\nA monolithic kernel is an operating system kernel in which all the operating system services run in kernel space, meaning they all share the same memory space. This type of kernel is characterized by its tight integration of system services and its high performance.\n\nBelow is the diagrammatic representation of the Monolithic Kernel:\n\n![Monolithic Kernel](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240717100829/Screenshot-2024-07-17-100752.png)\n\nMonolithic Kernel\n\n### **Advantages of Monolithic Kernel**\n\n- One of the major advantages of having a monolithic kernel is that it provides [CPU scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/), [memory management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/), file management, and other operating system functions through [system calls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/).\n- The other one is that it is a single large process running entirely in a single address space.\n- It is a single static binary file. Examples of some Monolithic Kernel-based OSs are Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400, z/TPF.\n- No need for complex inter-process communication (IPC), which speeds up system call execution.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Monolithic Kernel**\n\n- **Stability Issues**: One of the major disadvantages of a monolithic kernel is that if anyone service fails it leads to an entire system failure.\n- **Lack of Modularity**: If the user has to add any new service. The user needs to modify the entire [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/).\n- **Security Risks**: A bug or vulnerability in any service can affect the entire system since all services run in kernel mode.\n- **Large Size**: The kernel can become very large and complex as more services are added.\n\n## What is Microkernel?\n\nA microkernel is a type of operating system kernel in which only the most basic services run in kernel space, with other services running in user space. This type of kernel is characterized by its modularity, simplicity, and ability to run multiple operating systems on the same hardware.\n\nThe microkernel itself typically includes only the most fundamental services, such as:\n\n- **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: Mechanisms for processes to communicate and [synchronize](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) with each other.\n- **Basic Scheduling**: Managing the execution of processes.\n- **Minimal Memory Management**: Essential functions for memory allocation and protection.\n\nOther functionalities that are often part of a monolithic kernel, like [device drivers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/device-driver-and-its-purpose/), file systems, and network protocols, are implemented in user space as separate processes. This contrasts with a monolithic kernel, where all these services run in kernel space.\n\n## Kernel Space vs User Space\n\nBefore comparing types of kernels, it\u2019s important to know whether components run in kernel space or user space, as this impacts how the system works.\n\nIn an operating system, there are two main areas where code runs: user space and kernel space. **User space is where user applications run, while kernel space is where the operating system and other important parts run**. In kernel space, code can directly access system resources like memory and hardware, allowing it to perform special tasks that user space code can\u2019t.\n\nSystem calls are important for connecting user space and kernel space. They let user applications ask the kernel for specific services. When an application makes a system call, it switches from user space to kernel space, allowing the kernel to do what the application requested.\n\n## Key Differences Between Monolithic and Micro Kernel\n\n- **System Services:** In a monolithic kernel, all system services run in kernel space, whereas in a microkernel, only the most basic services (such as memory management and process scheduling) run in kernel space, with other services running in user space.\n- **Performance:** Monolithic kernels are generally faster and more efficient than microkernels, because there is no overhead associated with moving data between kernel space and user space.\n- **Modularity:** Microkernels are more modular than monolithic kernels, because services are separated into different processes running in user space. This makes it easier to add or remove services without affecting other parts of the system.\n- **Security:** Microkernels are generally considered more secure than monolithic kernels, because a bug or vulnerability in a service running in user space is less likely to affect the entire system.\n- **Development:** Developing a monolithic kernel is generally simpler and faster than developing a microkernel, because all system services are integrated and share the same memory space.\n\n## Differences Between Monolithic Kernel and Microkernel\n\n| Basics | Micro Kernel | Monolithic Kernel |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Size** | Smaller | Larger as OS and both user lie in the same address space. |\n| **Execution** | Slower | Faster |\n| **Extendible** | Easily extendible | Complex to extend |\n| **Security** | If the service crashes then there is no effect on working on the microkernel. | If the process/service crashes, the whole system crashes as both user and OS were in the same address space. |\n| **Code** | More code is required to write a microkernel. | Less code is required to write a monolithic kernel. |\n| **Examples** | L4Linux, macOS | Windows, Linux BSD |\n| **Security** | More secure because only essential services run in kernel mode | Susceptible to security vulnerabilities due to the amount of code running in kernel mode |\n| **Platform independence** | More portable because most drivers and services run in user space | Less portable due to direct hardware access |\n| **Communication** | Message passing between user-space servers | Direct function calls within [kernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/) |\n| **Performance** | Lower due to message passing and more overhead | High due to direct function calls and less overhead |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, [monolithic kernels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monolithic-architecture/) are characterized by their tight integration of system services and high performance, while [microkernels](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/microkernel-in-operating-systems/) are characterized by their modularity, simplicity, and security. The choice between a monolithic and microkernel architecture depends on the specific needs and requirements of the operating system being developed.\n\n## **Monolithic Kernel and Key Differences From Microkernel \u2013 FAQs**\n\n### **What are some examples of operating systems that use a monolithic kernel?**\n\n> Examples of monolithic kernel-based operating systems include Unix, Linux, Open VMS, XTS-400, and z/TPF.\n\n### **What are some examples of operating systems that use a microkernel?**\n\n> Examples of microkernel-based operating systems include L4Linux and macOS.\n\n### **Which kernel architecture is more secure?**\n\n> Microkernels are generally considered more secure than monolithic kernels because a bug or vulnerability in a service running in user space is less likely to affect the entire system.\n\n### **Which kernel architecture is more modular?**\n\n> Microkernels are more modular than monolithic kernels because services are separated into different processes running in user space.

For example, if a process stuck in the infinite loop then this infinite loop could affect the correct operation of other processes. So to ensure the proper execution of the operating system, there are two modes of operation:\n\n**User mode \u2013**\n\nWhen the computer system is run by user applications like creating a text document or using any application program, then the system is in user mode. When the user application requests for a service from the operating system or an interrupt occurs or [system call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-introduction-system-call/), then there will be a transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill the requests.\n\n> **Note:** To switch from kernel mode to user mode, the mode bit should be 1.\n\nGiven below image describes what happens when an interruption occurs:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dual_mode.jpeg)\n\n**Kernel Mode:** When the system boots, the hardware starts in kernel mode and when the operating system is loaded, it starts user application in user mode. To provide protection to the hardware, we have privileged instructions which execute only in kernel mode. If the user attempts to run privileged instruction in user mode then it will treat instruction as illegal and traps to OS. Some of the privileged instructions are:\n\n1. Handling Interrupts\n2. To switch from user mode to kernel mode.\n3. Input-Output management.\n\n**Need for Dual Mode Operations:**\n\nCertain types of tasks do not require any type of hardware support, that\u2019s why certain types of processes are to be made hidden from the user. These tasks can be deal separately by using the Dual Mode of the operating system.\n\nThe Kernel Level programs perform all the bottom level functions of the operating systems like memory management, process management etc, for this purpose the operating system needs to function in the Dual Mode. Dual Mode is necessary for specifying the access to the users only to the tasks of their use in an operating system.\n\nBasically, whenever the operating system works on the user applications, it held in the user mode. When the user requests for some hardware services, a transition from User Mode to the Kernel Mode occurs which is done by changing the mode bit from 1 to 0. Also the mode bit again changed to 1 for returning back in the User Mode.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n1. **Protection:** Dual-mode operation provides a layer of protection between user programs and the operating system. In user mode, programs are restricted from accessing privileged resources, such as hardware devices or sensitive system data. In kernel mode, the operating system has full access to these resources, allowing it to protect the system from malicious or unauthorized access.\n2. **Stability:** Dual-mode operation helps to ensure system stability by preventing user programs from interfering with system-level operations. By restricting access to privileged resources in user mode, the operating system can prevent programs from accidentally or maliciously causing system crashes or other errors.\n3. **Flexibility: Dual-mode** operation allows the operating system to support a wide range of applications and hardware devices. By providing a well-defined interface between user programs and the operating system, it is easier to develop and deploy new applications and hardware.\n4. **Debugging: Dual-mode** operation makes it easier to debug and diagnose problems with the operating system and applications. By switching between user mode and kernel mode, developers can identify and fix issues more quickly and easily.\n5. **Security:** Dual-mode operation enhances system security by preventing unauthorized access to critical system resources. User programs running in user mode cannot modify system data or perform privileged operations, reducing the risk of malware attacks or other security threats.\n6. **Efficiency:** Dual-mode operation can improve system performance by reducing overhead associated with system-level operations. By allowing user programs to access resources directly in user mode, the operating system can avoid unnecessary context switches and other performance penalties.\n7. **Compatibility:** Dual-mode operation ensures backward compatibility with legacy applications and hardware devices. By providing a standard interface for user programs to interact with the operating system, it is easier to maintain compatibility with older software and hardware.\n8. **Isolation:** Dual-mode operation provides isolation between user programs, preventing one program from interfering with another. By running each program in its own protected memory space, the operating system can prevent programs from accessing each other\u2019s data or causing conflicts.\n9. **Reliability:** Dual-mode operation enhances system reliability by preventing crashes and other errors caused by user programs. By restricting access to critical system resources, the operating system can ensure that system-level operations are performed correctly and reliably.\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n1. **Performance:** Dual-mode operation can introduce overhead and reduce system performance. Switching between user mode and kernel mode requires a context switch, which can be time-consuming and can impact system performance.\n2. **Complexity: Dual-mode** operation can increase system complexity and make it more difficult to develop and maintain operating systems. The need to support both user mode and kernel mode can make it more challenging to design and implement system features and to ensure system stability.\n3. **Security:** Dual-mode operation can introduce security vulnerabilities. Malicious programs may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system to gain access to privileged resources or to execute malicious code.\n4. **Reliability:** Dual-mode operation can introduce reliability issues as it is difficult to test and verify the correct operation of both user mode and kernel mode. Bugs or errors in either mode can lead to system crashes, data corruption, or other reliability issues.\n5. **Compatibility:** Dual-mode operation can create compatibility issues as different operating systems may implement different interfaces or policies for user mode and kernel mode. This can make it difficult to develop applications that are compatible with multiple operating systems or to migrate applications between different systems.\n6. **Development complexity:** Dual-mode operation requires a higher level of technical expertise and development skills to design and implement the operating system. This can increase the development time and cost for creating new operating systems or updating existing ones.\n7. **Maintenance complexity:** Dual-mode operation can make maintenance and support more complex due to the need to ensure compatibility and security across both user mode and kernel mode. This can increase the cost and time required for system updates, patches, and upgrades.\n\n> **Note:** To switch from user mode to kernel mode bit should be 0.\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**What is the purpose of dual-mode operation?**\n\nDual-mode operation is designed to provide a layer of protection and stability to computer systems by separating user programs and the operating system into two modes: user mode and kernel mode. User mode restricts access to privileged resources, while kernel mode has full access to these resources.\n\n**How does dual-mode operation improve system performance?**\n\nBy allowing user programs to access resources directly in user mode, the operating system can avoid unnecessary context switches and other performance penalties, which can improve system performance.\n\n**What are some common privileged instructions in kernel mode?**\n\nSome common privileged instructions in kernel mode include handling interrupts, switching from user mode to kernel mode, and input-output management.\n\n**How can dual-mode operation enhance system security?**\n\nThe dual-mode operation can enhance system security by preventing unauthorized access to critical system resources. User programs running in user mode cannot modify system data or perform privileged operations, reducing the risk of malware attacks or other security threats.\n\n**What are some potential drawbacks of dual-mode operation?**\n\nSome potential drawbacks of dual-mode operation include increased complexity and development/maintenance costs, security vulnerabilities, and potential performance issues due to context switching. However, these drawbacks are generally outweighed by the benefits of dual-mode operation in terms of system stability, security, and flexibility.\n\nRead next \u2013 [User Level thread Vs Kernel Level thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-user-level-thread-vs-kernel-level-thread/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/os-file-operations/?ref=next_article)\n\n[OS File Operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/os-file-operations/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shivani.mittal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[shivani.mittal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shivani.mittal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n79\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Dual Mode operations in OS\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAn error in one program can adversely affect many processes, it might modify data of another program or also can affect the operating system.
