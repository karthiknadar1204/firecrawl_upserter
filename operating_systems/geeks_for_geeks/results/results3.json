Each user can have as many directories as are needed so, that files can be grouped together in a natural way. Advantages of this structure:\n\n- Searching is efficient\n- Groping capability of files increase\n\nWhen the file system is organized as a directory tree, some way is needed for specifying file names. Two different methods are commonly used:\n\n1. **Absolute Path name \u2013** In this method, each file is given an **absolute path** name consisting of the path from the root directory to the file. As an example, the path **/usr/ast/mailbox** means that the root directory contains a subdirectory usr, which in turn contains a subdirectory ast, which contains the file mailbox. Absolute path names always start at the root directory and are unique. In UNIX the components of the path are separated by \u2018/\u2019. In Windows, the separator is \u2018\\\\\u2019. **Windows** \\\\usr\\\\ast\\\\mailbox **UNIX** /usr/ast/mailbox\n2. **Relative Path name \u2013** This is used in conjunction with the concept of the **working directory** (also called the **current directory**).A user can designate one directory as the current working directory, in which case all path names not beginning at the root directory are taken relative to the working directory. For **example**, if the current working directory is /usr/ast, then the file whose absolute path is /usr/ast/mailbox can be referenced simply as mailbox. In other words, the UNIX command : **cp /usr/ast/mailbox /usr/ast/mailbox.bak** and the command : **cp mailbox mailbox.bak** do exactly the same thing if the working directory is /usr/ast.\n\n**When to use which approach?** Some programs need to access a specific file without regard to what the working directory is. In that case, they should always use absolute path names. For example, a spelling checker might need to read /usr/lib/dictionary to do its work. It should use the full, absolute path name in this case because it does not know what the working directory will be when it is called. The absolute path name will always work, no matter what the working directory is. Of course, if the spelling checker needs a large number of files from /usr/lib, an alternative approach is for it to issue a system call to change its working directory to /usr/lib, and then use just dictionary as the first parameter to open. By explicitly changing the working directory, it knows for sure where it is in the directory tree, so it can then use relative paths.\n\n**Why would you use an absolute path name instead of a relative path name?**\n\nAbsolute path names provide an unambiguous way to refer to a file or directory regardless of the current working directory. This is useful when you need to specify a file or directory location in a command or script that will be run in different working directories. It is also useful when referring to files or directories that are located in the same location on different machines.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-print-root-directories/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Java \\| Print root directories](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-print-root-directories/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/2967cjt4qermkho14oy8)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/chirag%20darji/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[chirag darji](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/chirag%20darji/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n7\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/misc/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Misc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Misc&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Path Name in File Directory\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite - File Systems Hierarchical Directory Systems - Directory is maintained in the form of a tree.

It organizes files and folders in a hierarchical manner.\u00a0In other words, directories are like folders that help organize files on a computer. Just like you use folders to keep your papers and documents in order, the operating system uses directories to keep track of files and where they are stored. Different structures of directories can be used to organize these files, making it easier to find and manage them.\n\nUnderstanding these directory structures is important because it helps in efficiently organizing and accessing files on your computer. Following are the logical structures of a directory, each providing a solution to the problem faced in the previous type of directory structure.\n\n![Directory in operating system](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/111-11.png)\n\n## Different Types of Directory in OS\n\nIn an operating system, there are different types of directory structures that help organize and manage files efficiently.\n\n**Directories in an OS** can be single-level, two-level, or hierarchical. To gain a comprehensive understanding of file systems, explore the [**GATE CS Self-Paced Course**](https://gfgcdn.com/tu/Rs0/) which covers operating systems in great detail.\n\nEach type of directory has its own way of arranging files and directories, offering unique benefits and features.These are:\n\n- Single-Level Directory\n- Two-Level Directory\n- Tree Structure/ Hierarchical Structure\n- Acyclic Graph Structure\n- General-Graph Directory Structure\n\n## **1) Single-Level Directory**\n\nThe single-level directory is the **simplest directory structure**. In it, all files are contained in the same directory which makes it easy to support and understand.\n\nA single level directory has a significant limitation, however, when the number of files increases or when the system has more than one user. Since all the files are in the same directory, they must have a **unique name**. If two users call their dataset test, then the unique name rule violated.\n\n![Single Level Directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/222-13.png)\n\n### **Advantages**\n\n- Since it is a single directory, so its implementation is very easy.\n- If the files are smaller in size, searching will become faster.\n- The operations like file creation, searching, deletion, updating are very easy in such a directory structure.\n- **Logical Organization** : Directory structures help to logically organize files and directories in a hierarchical structure. This provides an easy way to navigate and manage files, making it easier for users to access the data they need.\n- **Increased Efficiency:** Directory structures can increase the efficiency of the file system by reducing the time required to search for files. This is because directory structures are optimized for fast file access, allowing users to quickly locate the file they need.\n- **Improved Security** : Directory structures can provide better security for files by allowing access to be restricted at the directory level. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and ensures that important files are protected.\n- **Facilitates Backup and Recovery** : Directory structures make it easier to [backup and recover](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backup-and-restore/) files in the event of a system failure or data loss. By storing related files in the same directory, it is easier to locate and backup all the files that need to be protected.\n- **Scalability:** Directory structures are scalable, making it easy to add new directories and files as needed. This helps to accommodate growth in the system and makes it easier to manage large amounts of data.\n\n### **Disadvantages**\n\n- There may chance of name collision because two files can have the same name.\n- Searching will become time taking if the directory is large.\n- This can not group the same type of files together.\n\n## **2) Two-Level Directory**\n\nAs we have seen, a single level directory often leads to confusion of files names among different users. The solution to this problem is to create a **separate directory for each user**.\n\nIn the two-level directory structure, each user has their own **user files directory (UFD).** The UFDs have similar structures, but each lists only the files of a single user. System\u2019s **master file directory (MFD** _**)**_ is searched whenever a new user id is created.\n\n![Two Level Directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620202955/d1.png)\n\nTwo-Levels Directory Structure\n\n### Advantages\n\n- The main advantage is there can be more than two files with same name, and would be very helpful if there are multiple users.\n- A security would be there which would prevent user to access other user\u2019s files.\n- Searching of the files becomes very easy in this directory structure.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- As there is advantage of security, there is also disadvantage that the user cannot share the file with the other users.\n- Unlike the advantage users can create their own files, users don\u2019t have the ability to create subdirectories.\n- Scalability is not possible because one user can\u2019t group the same types of files together.\n\n## 3) Tree Structure/ Hierarchical Structure\n\nTree directory structure of operating system is most commonly used in our [**personal computers**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-computers/). User can create files and subdirectories too, which was a disadvantage in the previous directory structures.\n\nThis directory structure resembles a real tree upside down, where the **root directory** is at the peak. This root contains all the directories for each user. The users can create subdirectories and even store files in their directory.\n\nA user do not have access to the root directory data and cannot modify it. And, even in this directory the user do not have access to other user\u2019s directories. \u00a0The structure of tree directory is given below which shows how there are files and subdirectories in each user\u2019s directory.\n\n![Tree Structure Directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620221412/d2.png)\n\nTree/Hierarchical Directory Structure\n\n### Advantages\n\n- This directory structure allows subdirectories inside a directory.\n- The searching is easier.\n- File sorting of important and unimportant becomes easier.\n- This directory is more scalable than the other two directory structures explained.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- As the user isn\u2019t allowed to access other user\u2019s directory, this prevents the file sharing among users.\n- As the user has the capability to make subdirectories, if the number of subdirectories increase the searching may become complicated.\n- Users cannot modify the root directory data.\n- If files do not fit in one, they might have to be fit into other directories.\n\n## 4) Acyclic Graph Structure\n\nAs we have seen the above three directory structures, where none of them have the capability to access one file from multiple directories. The file or the subdirectory could be accessed through the directory it was present in, but not from the other directory.\n\nThis problem is solved in acyclic graph directory structure, where a file in one directory can be accessed from multiple directories. In this way, the files could be shared in between the users. It is designed in a way that multiple directories point to a particular directory or file with the help of links.\n\nIn the below figure, this explanation can be nicely observed, where a file is shared between multiple users. If any user makes a change, it would be reflected to both the users.\n\n![Acyclic group structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230620221731/d3.png)\n\nAcyclic Graph Structure\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Sharing of files and directories is allowed between multiple users.\n- Searching becomes too easy.\n- Flexibility is increased as file sharing and editing access is there for multiple users.\n\n### Disadvantages\n\n- Because of the complex structure it has, it is difficult to implement this directory structure.\n- The user must be very cautious to edit or even deletion of file as the file is accessed by multiple users.\n- If we need to delete the file, then we need to delete all the references of the file inorder to delete it permanently.\n\n## 5) General-Graph Directory Structure\n\nUnlike the acyclic-graph directory, which avoids loops, the general-graph directory can have cycles, meaning a directory can contain paths that loop back to the starting point. This can make navigating and managing files more complex.\n\n![General Graph directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240704112942/Screenshot-2024-07-04-112917.png)\n\nGeneral Graph Directory Structure\n\nIn the above image, you can see that a cycle is formed in the User 2 directory. While this structure offers more flexibility, it is also more complicated to implement.\n\n### **Advantages of General-Graph Directory**\n\n- More flexible than other directory structures.\n- Allows cycles, meaning directories can loop back to each other.\n\n### **Disadvantages of General-Graph Directory**\n\n- More expensive to implement compared to other solutions.\n- Requires garbage collection to manage and clean up unused files and directories.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the different directory structures in an [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) is important for efficient file organization and management. Each structure, whether single-level, two-level, tree-structured, acyclic graph, or general graph, offers unique ways to arrange and access files. Choosing the right directory structure helps ensure that files are easy to find, use, and maintain.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Directory Structure \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is a root Directory?\n\n> A root directory is a fundamental concept in directory structure of OS. It is a parent directory that is a top-level directory organised in a hierarchical manner and is represented by a forward slash \u201c/\u201d in a unix like systems & a backslash in windows \u201c\\\\\u201d.\n\n### What is a purpose of a directory structure?\n\n> The sole purpose of a directory structure is to provide a way to store and oragnise files & data in an efficient manner so that access and management of all the files can be done by the user in the simplest and productive manner.\n\n### What is a sub-directory ?\n\n> A sub-directory is a directory inside another directory. Inside a directory structure, a user can create many directories inside a directory. These are called sub-directories.\n\n### What are some common directory structures used in Operating System?\n\n> Most common directory structures used to store and organise files are \u2013 Single-Level, Two-Level, tree-like directory structures. Tree structure is generally used in modern personal computers.\n\n### What are most common system calls made while managing files through a directory structure?\n\n> Following system calls are majorly used :\n>\n> - mkdir() : this system call is made when creating a new file through GUI or through command line\n> - open() : This call is made when opening a file inside a directory structure\n> - close() : This call is made when we close a file in a directory structure\n> - unlink() : This call is made to unlike a file from other directories before deleting it\n> - rmdir : This call is made to remove a directory from a file system\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-approaches-or-structures-of-operating-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Operating Systems Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-approaches-or-structures-of-operating-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AshishVishwakarma1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[AshishVishwakarma1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AshishVishwakarma1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n116\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems-Input Output Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/operating-systems-input-output-systems/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Structures of Directory in Operating System\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA directory is a container that is used to contain folders and files.

There are three main disk space or file allocation methods.\n\n- Contiguous Allocation\n- Linked Allocation\n- Indexed Allocation\n\nThe main idea behind these methods is to provide:\n\n- Efficient disk space utilization.\n- Fast access to the file blocks.\n\nAll the three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages as discussed below:\n\n**1\\. Contiguous Allocation**\n\nIn this scheme, each file occupies a contiguous set of blocks on the disk. For example, if a file requires n blocks and is given a block b as the starting location, then the blocks assigned to the file will be: _b, b+1, b+2,\u2026\u2026b+n-1._ This means that given the starting block address and the length of the file (in terms of blocks required), we can determine the blocks occupied by the file.\n\nThe directory entry for a file with contiguous allocation contains\n\n- Address of starting block\n- Length of the allocated portion.\n\nThe _file \u2018mail\u2019_ in the following figure starts from the block 19 with length = 6 blocks. Therefore, it occupies _19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24_ blocks.\n\n[![pic](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Contiguous-Allocation.jpg)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Contiguous-Allocation.jpg)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Both the Sequential and Direct Accesses are supported by this. For direct access, the address of the kth block of the file which starts at block b can easily be obtained as (b+k).\n- This is extremely fast since the number of seeks are minimal because of contiguous allocation of file blocks.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- This method suffers from both internal and external fragmentation. This makes it inefficient in terms of memory utilization.\n- Increasing file size is difficult because it depends on the availability of contiguous memory at a particular instance.\n\n**2\\. Linked List Allocation**\n\nIn this scheme, each file is a linked list of disk blocks which **need not be** contiguous. The disk blocks can be scattered anywhere on the disk.\n\nThe directory entry contains a pointer to the starting and the ending file block. Each block contains a pointer to the next block occupied by the file.\n\n_The file \u2018jeep\u2019 in following image shows how the blocks are randomly distributed. The last block (25) contains -1 indicating a null pointer and does not point to any other block._\n\n[![linked](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/linkedListAllocation.jpg)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/linkedListAllocation.jpg)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- This is very flexible in terms of file size. File size can be increased easily since the system does not have to look for a contiguous chunk of memory.\n- This method does not suffer from external fragmentation. This makes it relatively better in terms of memory utilization.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- Because the file blocks are distributed randomly on the disk, a large number of seeks are needed to access every block individually. This makes linked allocation slower.\n- It does not support random or direct access. We can not directly access the blocks of a file. A block k of a file can be accessed by traversing k blocks sequentially (sequential access ) from the starting block of the file via block pointers.\n- Pointers required in the linked allocation incur some extra overhead.\n\n**3\\. Indexed Allocation**\n\nIn this scheme, a special block known as the **Index block** contains the pointers to all the blocks occupied by a file. Each file has its own index block. The ith entry in the index block contains the disk address of the ith file block. The directory entry contains the address of the index block as shown in the image:\n\n[![indexed](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/indexedAllocation.jpg)](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/indexedAllocation.jpg)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- This supports direct access to the blocks occupied by the file and therefore provides fast access to the file blocks.\n- It overcomes the problem of external fragmentation.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- The pointer overhead for indexed allocation is greater than linked allocation.\n- For very small files, say files that expand only 2-3 blocks, the indexed allocation would keep one entire block (index block) for the pointers which is inefficient in terms of memory utilization. However, in linked allocation we lose the space of only 1 pointer per block.\n\nFor files that are very large, single index block may not be able to hold all the pointers.\n\nFollowing mechanisms can be used to resolve this:\n\n1. **Linked scheme:** This scheme links two\u00a0or more index blocks together for holding the pointers. Every index block would then contain a pointer or the address to the next index block.\n2. **Multilevel index:** In this policy, a first level index block is used to point to the second level index blocks which inturn points to the disk blocks occupied by the file. This can be extended to 3 or more levels depending on the maximum file size.\n3. **Combined Scheme:** In this scheme, a special block called the **Inode (information Node)** contains all the information about the file such as the name, size, authority, etc and the remaining space of Inode is used to store the Disk Block addresses which contain the actual file _as shown in the image below._ The first few of these pointers in Inode point to the **direct blocks** i.e the pointers contain the addresses of the disk blocks that contain data of the file.

There are several ways to access this information in the file. Some systems provide only one access method for files. Other systems, such as those of IBM, support many access methods, and choosing the right one for a particular application is a major design problem.\n\nThese methods determine how data is organized, retrieved, and modified within a file system. Understanding file access methods is crucial for efficient data management and system performance. In this article, we are going to discuss different types of methods to access the file.\n\n# File Access Methods\n\nThere are three ways to access a file in a computer system:\n\n- Sequential-Access\n- Direct Access\n- Index sequential Method\n\n## **Sequential Access**\n\nIt is the simplest access method. Information in the file is processed in order, one record after the other. This mode of access is by far the most common; for example, the editor and compiler usually access the file in this fashion.\n\nRead and write make up the bulk of the operation on a file. A read operation _-read next-_ reads the next position of the file and automatically advances a file pointer, which keeps track of the I/O location. Similarly, for the -write _next-_ append to the end of the file and advance to the newly written material.\n\n![Sequential-Method-Access](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240621114116/Sequential-Method-Access.png)\n\nSequential Access Method\n\n### **Key Points related to Sequential Access**\n\n- Data is accessed from one record right after another record in an order.\n- When we use the read command, it moves ahead pointer by one.\n- When we use the write command, it will allocate memory and move the pointer to the end of the file.\n- Such a method is reasonable for tape.\n\n### **Advantages of Sequential Access Method**\n\n- It is simple to implement this file access mechanism.\n- It uses [lexicographic order](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-an-array-of-strings-in-lexicographical-order/) to quickly access the next entry.\n- It is suitable for applications that require access to all records in a file, in a specific order.\n- It is less prone to data corruption as the data is written sequentially and not randomly.\n- It is a more efficient method for reading large files, as it only reads the required data and does not waste time reading unnecessary data.\n- It is a reliable method for [backup and restore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backup-and-restore/) operations, as the data is stored sequentially and can be easily restored if required.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Sequential Access Method**\n\n- If the file record that needs to be accessed next is not present next to the current record, this type of file access method is slow.\n- Moving a sizable chunk of the file may be necessary to insert a new record.\n- It does not allow for quick access to specific records in the file. The entire file must be searched sequentially to find a specific record, which can be time-consuming.\n- It is not well-suited for applications that require frequent updates or modifications to the file. Updating or inserting a record in the middle of a large file can be a slow and cumbersome process.\n- Sequential access can also result in wasted storage space if records are of varying lengths. The space between records cannot be used by other records, which can result in inefficient use of storage.\n\n## **Direct Access Method**\n\nAnother method is _direct access method_ also known as _relative access method_. A fixed-length logical record that allows the program to read and write record rapidly. in no particular order. The direct access is based on the disk model of a file since disk allows random access to any file block. For direct access, the file is viewed as a numbered sequence of block or record. Thus, we may read block 14 then block 59, and then we can write block 17. There is no restriction on the order of reading and writing for a direct access file.\n\nA block number provided by the user to the operating system is normally a _relative block number_, the first relative block of the file is 0 and then 1 and so on.\n\n![Direct Access Method](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240621114802/Screenshot-2024-06-21-114724.png)\n\nDirect Access Method\n\n### **Advantages of Direct Access Method**\n\n- The files can be immediately accessed decreasing the average access time.\n- In the direct access method, in order to access a block, there is no need of traversing all the blocks present before it.\n\n### Disadvantages of Direct Access Method\n\n- **Complex Implementation** : Implementing direct access can be complex, requiring sophisticated algorithms and data structures to manage and locate records efficiently.\n- **Higher Storage Overhead** : Direct access methods often require additional storage for maintaining data location information (such as pointers or address tables), which can increase the overall storage requirements.\n\n## **Index Sequential method**\n\nIt is the other method of accessing a file that is built on the top of the sequential access method. These methods construct an index for the file. The index, like an index in the back of a book, contains the pointer to the various blocks. To find a record in the file, we first search the index, and then by the help of pointer we access the file directly.\n\n#### **Key Points Related to Index Sequential Method**\n\n- It is built on top of Sequential access.\n- It control the pointer by using index.\n\n#### Advantages of Index Sequential Method\n\n- **Efficient Searching** : Index sequential method allows for quick searches through the index.\n- **Balanced Performance** : It combines the simplicity of sequential access with the speed of direct access, offering a balanced approach that can handle various types of data access needs efficiently.\n- **Flexibility** : This method allows both sequential and random access to data, making it versatile for different types of applications, such as batch processing and real-time querying.\n- **Improved Data Management** : [Indexing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indexing-in-databases-set-1/) helps in better organization and management of data. It makes data retrieval faster and more efficient, especially in large databases.\n- **Reduced Access Time** : By using an index to directly locate data blocks, the time spent searching for data within large datasets is significantly reduced.\n\n#### Disadvantages of Index Sequential Method\n\n- **Complex Implementation** : The index sequential method is more complex to implement and maintain compared to simple sequential access methods.\n- **Additional Storage** : Indexes require additional storage space, which can be significant for large datasets. This extra space can sometimes offset the benefits of faster access.\n- **Update Overhead** : Updating the data can be more time-consuming because both the data and the indexes need to be updated. This can lead to increased processing time for insertions, deletions, and modifications.\n- **Index Maintenance** : Keeping the index up to date requires regular maintenance, especially in dynamic environments where data changes frequently. This can add to the system\u2019s overhead.\n\n## Other Way of File Access\n\n### **1\\. Relative Record Access**\n\nRelative record access is a file access method used in operating systems where records are accessed relative to the current position of the file pointer. In this method, records are located based on their position relative to the current record, rather than by a specific address or key value.\n\n### **Key Points Related to Relative Record Access**\n\n- Relative record access is a random access method that allows records to be accessed based on their position relative to the current record.\n- This method is efficient for accessing individual records but may not be suitable for files that require frequent updates or random access to specific records.\n- Relative record access requires fixed-length records and may not be flexible enough for some applications.\n- This method is useful for processing records in a specific order or for files that are accessed sequentially.\n\n### **Advantages of Relative Record Access**\n\n- **Random Access:** Relative record access allows random access to records in a file. The system can access any record at a specific offset from the current position of the file pointer.\n- **Efficient Retrieval:** Since the system only needs to read the current record and any records that need to be skipped, relative record access is more efficient than sequential access for accessing individual records.\n- **Useful for Sequential Processing:** Relative record access is useful for processing records in a specific order. For example, if the records are sorted in a specific order, the system can access the next or previous record relative to the current position of the file pointer.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Relative Record Access**\n\n- **Fixed Record Length:** Relative record access requires fixed-length records. If the records are of varying length, it may be necessary to use padding to ensure that each record is the same length.\n- **Limited Flexibility:** Relative record access is not very flexible. It is difficult to insert or delete records in the middle of a file without disrupting the relative positions of other records.\n- **Limited Application:** Relative record access is best suited for files that are accessed sequentially or with some regularity, but it may not be appropriate for files that are frequently updated or require random access to specific records.\n\n### **2\\. Content Addressable Access**\n\nContent-addressable access (CAA) is a file access method used in operating systems that allows records or blocks to be accessed based on their content rather than their address. In this method, a hash function is used to calculate a unique key for each record or block, and the system can access any record or block by specifying its key.\n\n### **Keys in Content-Addressable Access**\n\n- **Unique:** Each record or block has a [unique key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unique-key-in-dbms/) that is generated using a hash function.\n- **Calculated based on content:** The key is calculated based on the content of the record or block, rather than its location or address.\n\n### **Key Points Related to Content-Addressable Access**\n\n- Content-addressable access is a file access method that allows records or blocks to be accessed based on their content rather than their address.\n- CAA uses a hash function to generate a unique key for each record or block.\n- CAA is efficient for searching large [databases](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-databases/) or file systems and is more flexible than other access methods.\n- CAA requires additional overhead for calculating the hash function and may have collisions or limited key space.\n\n### **Advantages of Content-Addressable Access**\n\n- **Efficient Search:** CAA is ideal for searching large databases or file systems because it allows for efficient searching based on the content of the records or blocks.\n- **Flexibility:** CAA is more flexible than other access methods because it allows for easy insertion and deletion of records or blocks.\n- **Data Integrity** : CAA ensures data integrity because each record or block has a unique key that is generated based on its content.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Content-Addressable Access**\n\n- **Overhead:** CAA requires additional overhead because the [hash function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hash-functions-and-list-types-of-hash-functions/) must be calculated for each record or block.\n- **Collision:** There is a possibility of collision where two records or blocks can have the same key. This can be minimized by using a good hash function, but it cannot be completely eliminated.\n- **Limited Key Space:** The key space is limited by the size of the hash function used, which can lead to collisions and other issues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, file access methods are essential for how an [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) reads and writes data to storage devices. Different methods, like sequential access, direct access, and indexed access, each have their unique benefits and use cases. Sequential access is great for simple, linear data processing, direct access is perfect for quickly retrieving specific data, and indexed access helps in efficient searching and organizing of data. Understanding these methods helps in choosing the best way to manage and access files, ensuring smooth and efficient operation of computer systems.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on File Access Methods \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Which file access method is best for databases?**\n\n> Direct access and indexed access are often best for databases. Direct access allows quick retrieval of specific records, while indexed access enhances search efficiency.\n\n### **How does sequential access affect performance?**\n\n> Sequential access is simple and efficient for linear data processing. However, it can be slow for tasks requiring frequent access to random parts of the file since it processes data in order.\n\n### **Can a file use more than one access method?**\n\n> Yes, a file can use more than one access method. For example, a database might use direct access for quick retrieval and indexed access for efficient searching.\n\n### **Is sequential access suitable for large files?**\n\n> Sequential access can be suitable for large files if they are processed in a linear fashion. However, for random access needs in large files, direct or indexed access may be more efficient.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inode-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Inode in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inode-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AshishVishwakarma1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[AshishVishwakarma1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AshishVishwakarma1/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n86\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems-Input Output Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/operating-systems-input-output-systems/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[File Access Methods in Operating System\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nFile access methods in an operating system are the techniques and processes used to read from and write to files stored on a computer's storage devices.

It is a group of registers. Memory are of two types (i) primary memory, (ii) secondary memory. Primary memory is made up of semiconductors, It is also divided into two types, Read-Only Memory (ROM) and Random Access Memory (RAM). Secondary memory is a physical device for the permanent storage of programs and data(Hard disk, Compact disc, Flash drive, etc.).\n\nSecondary memory is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and programs that can be accessed or retrieved even after the computer is turned off. Unlike primary memory, which is volatile and temporary, secondary memory is non-volatile and can store data and programs for extended periods of time.\n\n1. Some examples of secondary memory include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), optical discs (such as CDs and DVDs), and flash memory (such as USB drives and memory cards). These storage devices provide a much larger capacity than primary memory and are typically used to store large amounts of data, such as operating systems, application programs, media files, and other types of digital content.\n2. Secondary memory can be classified into two types: magnetic storage and solid-state storage. Magnetic storage devices, such as hard disk drives and magnetic tapes, use magnetic fields to store and retrieve data. Solid-state storage devices, such as solid-state drives and flash memory, use semiconductor-based memory chips to store data.\n3. One of the main advantages of secondary memory is its non-volatile nature, which means that data and programs stored on secondary memory can be accessed even after the computer is turned off. Additionally, secondary memory devices provide a large storage capacity, making it possible to store large amounts of data and programs.\n\nHowever, there are also some disadvantages to secondary memory, such as slower access times and lower read/write speeds compared to primary memory. Additionally, secondary memory devices are often more prone to mechanical failures and data corruption, which can result in data loss.\n\nOverall, secondary memory plays an important role in modern computing systems and is essential for storing large amounts of data and programs.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210525193336/memory-660x292.jpg)\n\n### Primary Memory\n\nPrimary memory is made up of semiconductors and it is the main memory of the computer system. It is generally used to store data or information on which the computer is currently working, so we can say that it is used to store data temporarily. Data or information is lost when the systems are off. It is also divided into two types:\n\n(i). Read-Only Memory (ROM)\n\n(ii). Random Access Memory (RAM).\n\n**1\\. Random Access Memory:** Primary memory is also called internal memory. This is the main area in a computer where data, instructions, and information are stored. Any storage location in this memory can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit. As the CPU can randomly access any storage location in this memory, it is also called Random Access Memory or RAM. The CPU can access data from RAM as long as the computer is switched on. As soon as the power to the computer is switched off, the stored data and instructions disappear from RAM. Such type of memory is known as volatile memory. RAM is also called read/write memory.\n\n**2\\. Read-Only Memory:** \u00a0Read-Only Memory (ROM) is a type of primary memory from which information can only be read. So it is also known as Read-Only Memory. ROM can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit. But, the data and instructions stored in ROM are retained even when the computer is switched off OR we can say it holds the data after being switched off. Such type of memory is known as non-volatile memory.\n\n### Secondary Memory\n\nWe have read so far, that primary memory is volatile and has limited capacity. So, it is important to have another form of memory that has a larger storage capacity and from which data and programs are not lost when the computer is turned off. Such a type of memory is called secondary memory. In secondary memory, programs and data are stored. It is also called auxiliary memory. It is different from primary memory as it is not directly accessible through the CPU and is non-volatile. Secondary or external storage devices have a much larger storage capacity and the cost of secondary memory is less as compared to primary memory.\n\n### Use of Secondary memory\n\nSecondary memory is used for different purposes but the main purposes of using secondary memory are:\n\n- **Permanent storage:** As we know that primary memory stores data only when the power supply is on, it loses data when the power is off. So we need a secondary memory to stores data permanently even if the power supply is off.\n- **Large Storage:** Secondary memory provides large storage space so that we can store large data like videos, images, audios, files, etc permanently.\n- **Portable:** Some secondary devices are removable. So, we can easily store or transfer data from one computer or device to another.\n\n### Types of Secondary memory\n\nSecondary memory is of two types:\n\n**1\\. Fixed storage**\n\nIn secondary memory, a fixed storage is an internal media device that is used to store data in a computer system. Fixed storage is generally known as fixed disk drives or hard drives. Generally, the data of the computer system is stored in a built-in fixed storage device. Fixed storage does not mean that you can not remove them from the computer system, you can remove the fixed storage device for repairing, for the upgrade, or for maintenance, etc. with the help of an expert or engineer.\n\n**Types of fixed storage:**\n\nFollowing are the types of fixed storage:\n\n- Internal flash memory (rare)\n- SSD (solid-state disk)\n- Hard disk drives (HDD)\n\n**2\\. Removable storage**\n\nIn secondary memory, removable storage is an external media device that is used to store data in a computer system. Removable storage is generally known as disks drives or external drives. It is a storage device that can be inserted or removed from the computer according to our requirements. We can easily remove them from the computer system while the computer system is running. Removable storage devices are portable so we can easily transfer data from one computer to another. Also, removable storage devices provide the fast data transfer rates associated with storage area networks (SANs).\n\n**Types of Removable Storage:**\n\n- Optical discs (like CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, etc.)\n- Memory cards\n- Floppy disks\n- Magnetic tapes\n- Disk packs\n- Paper storage (like punched tapes, punched cards, etc.)\n\n### Secondary memory devices\n\nFollowing are the commonly used secondary memory devices are:\n\n**1\\. Floppy Disk:** A floppy disk consists of a magnetic disc in a square plastic case. It is used to store data and to transfer data from one device to another device. Floppy disks are available in two sizes (a) Size: 3.5 inches, the Storage capacity of 1.44 MB (b) Size: 5.25 inches, the Storage capacity of 1.2 MB. To use a floppy disk, our computer needs to have a floppy disk drive. This storage device becomes obsolete now and has been replaced by CDs, DVDs, and flash drives.\n\n**2\\. Compact Disc:** A Compact Disc (CD) is a commonly used secondary storage device. It contains tracks and sectors on its surface. Its shape is circular and is made up of polycarbonate plastic. The storage capacity of CD is up to 700 MB of data. A CD may also be called a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory), in this computers can read the data present in a CD-ROM, but cannot write new data onto it. For a CD-ROM, we require a CD-ROM. CD is of two types:\n\n- **CD-R (compact disc recordable):** Once the data has been written onto it cannot be erased, it can only be read.\n- **CD-RW (compact disc rewritable):** It is a special type of CD in which data can be erased and rewritten as many times as we want. It is also called an erasable CD.\n\n**3\\. Digital Versatile Disc:** A Digital Versatile Disc also known as DVD it is looks just like a CD, but the storage capacity is greater compared to CD, it stores up to 4.7 GB of data. DVD-ROM drive is needed to use DVD on a computer. The video files, like movies or video recordings, etc., are generally stored on DVD and you can run DVD using the DVD player. DVD is of three types:\n\n- **DVD-ROM(Digital Versatile Disc Readonly):** In DVD-ROM the manufacturer writes the data in it and the user can only read that data, cannot write new data in it. \u00a0For example movie DVD, movie DVD is already written by the manufacturer we can only watch the movie but we cannot write new data into it.\n- **DVD-R(Digital Versatile Disc Recordable):** In DVD-R you can write the data but only one time. Once the data has been written onto it cannot be erased, it can only be read.\n- **DVD-RW(Digital Versatile Disc Rewritable and Erasable):** It is a special type of DVD in which data can be erased and rewritten as many times as we want. It is also called an erasable DVD.\n\n**4\\. Blu-ray Disc:** A Blu-ray disc looks just like a CD or a DVD but it can store data or information up to 25 GB data. If you want to use a Blu-ray disc, you need a Blu-ray reader. The name Blu-ray is derived from the technology that is used to read the disc \u2018Blu\u2019 from the blue-violet laser and \u2018ray\u2019 from an optical ray.\n\n**5\\. Hard Disk:** A hard disk is a part of a unit called a hard disk drive. It is used to storing a large amount of data. Hard disks or hard disk drives come in different storage capacities.(like 256 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB, and 2 TB, etc.). It is created using the collection of discs known as platters. The platters are placed one below the other. They are coated with magnetic material. Each platter consists of a number of invisible circles and each circle having the same centre called tracks. Hard disk is of two types (i) Internal hard disk (ii) External hard disk.\n\n**6\\. Flash Drive:** A flash drive or pen drive comes in various storage capacities, such as 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB, up to 1 TB. A flash drive is used to transfer and store data. To use a flash drive, we need to plug it into a USB port on a computer. As a flash drive is easy to use and compact in size, Nowadays it is very popular.\n\n**7\\. Solid-state disk:** It is also known as SDD. It is a non-volatile storage device that is used to store and access data. It is faster, does noiseless operations(because it does not contain any moving parts like the hard disk), consumes less power, etc. It is a great replacement for standard hard drives in computers and laptops if the price is low and it is also suitable for tablets, notebooks, etc because they do not require large storage.\n\n**8\\. SD Card:** It is known as a Secure Digital Card. It is generally used in portable devices like mobile phones, cameras, etc., to store data. It is available in different sizes like 1 GB, 2 GB, 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB, etc. To view the data stored in the SD card you can remove them from the device and insert them into a computer with help of a card reader. The data stores in the SD card is stored in memory chips(present in the SD Card) and it does not contain any moving parts like the hard disk.\n\n### Sample Problem\n\n**Question 1: What are the differences between primary and secondary memories?**\n\n**Solution:**\n\n> |     |     |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | **Primary Memory** | **Secondary Memory** |\n> | (i) Primary memory devices are semiconductor memories. | (i) Secondary memory devices are magnetic, optical and electronic memories. |\n> | (ii) Primary memory can be volatile as well as non-volatile.

So, it is important to have another form of memory that has a larger storage capacity and from which data and programs are not lost when the computer is turned off. Such a type of memory is known as secondary memory. Secondary memory has a much larger storage capacity than primary memory. Secondary memory is non-volatile memory.\n\n**Question 6: Name some secondary storage devices.**\n\n**Solution:**\n\n> Floppy disk, Hard disk, Compact disc, Digital versatile disc, Flash drive.\n\n**Question 7: Which secondary memory is faster, smaller**, **and more durable?**\n\n**Solution:**\n\n> Flash drive or Pen drive.\n\nHere are some advantages and disadvantages of secondary memory:\n\n### Advantages:\n\n1. Large storage capacity: Secondary memory devices typically have a much larger storage capacity than primary memory, allowing users to store large amounts of data and programs.\n2. Non-volatile storage: Data stored on secondary memory devices is typically non-volatile, meaning it can be retained even when the computer is turned off.\n3. Portability: Many secondary memory devices are portable, making it easy to transfer data between computers or devices.\n4. Cost-effective: Secondary memory devices are generally more cost-effective than primary memory.\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n1. Slower access times: Accessing data from secondary memory devices typically takes longer than accessing data from primary memory.\n2. Mechanical failures: Some types of secondary memory devices, such as hard disk drives, are prone to mechanical failures that can result in data loss.\n3. Limited lifespan: Secondary memory devices have a limited lifespan, and can only withstand a certain number of read and write cycles before they fail.\n4. Data corruption: Data stored on secondary memory devices can become corrupted due to factors such as electromagnetic interference, viruses, or physical damage.\n5. Overall, secondary memory is an essential component of modern computing systems, but it also has its limitations and drawbacks. The choice of a particular secondary memory device depends on the user\u2019s specific needs and requirements.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-memory-and-memory-units/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction to memory and memory units](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-memory-and-memory-units/?ref=next_article)\n\n[V](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/vivekray59/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[vivekray59](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/vivekray59/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n15\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Class 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/class-6/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-programming/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Fundamental Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis Computer Fundamental Tutorial covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, including computer hardware, software, operating systems, peripherals, etc. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, this tutorial is designed to enhance your computer skills and take them to the n\\\\\n\\\\\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-fundamentals-tutorial/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Introduction To Computer Fundamentals\n\n- [What is Computer?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA computer is an electronic device that can process and store information.

Secondary memory overcomes this limitation by providing permanent storage of data in bulk quantity. Secondary memory is also termed external memory and refers to the various storage media on which a computer can store data and programs. The Secondary storage media can be fixed or removable. Fixed Storage media is an internal storage medium like a hard disk that is fixed inside the computer.\n\n## What is a Hard Disk Drive?\n\nThe disk is divided into tracks. Each track is further divided into sectors. The point to be noted here is that the outer tracks are bigger than the inner tracks but they contain the same number of sectors and have equal storage capacity. This is because the storage density is high in sectors of the inner tracks whereas the bits are sparsely arranged in sectors of the outer tracks. Some space in every sector is used for formatting. So, the actual capacity of a sector is less than the given capacity.\u00a0The read-write (R-W) head moves over the rotating [hard disk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-hard-disk/). It is this Read-Write head that performs all the read and write operations on the disk and hence, the position of the R-W head is a major concern. To perform a read or write operation on a memory location, we need to place the R-W head over that position.\n\n**Hard disk drives (HDD)** serve as secondary storage, providing a non-volatile medium for data.\n\nSome important terms must be noted here:\n\n![HardDisk](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240307163841/harddisk1-(1).jpg)\n\nHard Disk Drive\n\n1. **Seek time \u2013** The time taken by the R-W head to reach the desired track from its current position.\n2. **Rotational latency \u2013** Time is taken by the sector to come under the R-W head.\n3. **Data transfer time \u2013** Time is taken to transfer the required amount of data. It depends upon the rotational speed.\n4. **Controller time \u2013** The processing time taken by the controller.\n5. **Average Access time \u2013** seek time + Average Rotational latency + data transfer time + controller time.\n\n**Note:** Average Rotational latency is mostly 1/2\\*(Rotational latency).\n\nIn questions, if the seek time and controller time are not mentioned, take them to be zero.\u00a0If the amount of data to be transferred is not given, assume that no data is being transferred. Otherwise, calculate the time taken to transfer the given amount of data.\u00a0The average rotational latency is taken when the current position of the R-W head is not given. Because the R-W may be already present at the desired position or it might take a whole rotation to get the desired sector under the R-W head. But, if the current position of the R-W head is given then the rotational latency must be calculated.\n\n**For Example \u2013**\n\n> **Consider a hard disk with:**\n>\n> - **4 surfaces**\n> - **64 tracks/surface**\n> - **128 sectors/track**\n> - **256 bytes/sector**\n>\n> **What is the capacity of the hard disk?**\n>\n> - **Disk capacity = surfaces \\* tracks/surface \\* sectors/track \\* bytes/sector**\n>\n>   Disk capacity = 4 \\* 64 \\* 128 \\* 256\n>\n>   Disk capacity = 8 MB\n>\n> **The disk is rotating at 3600 RPM, what is the data transfer rate?**\n>\n> - 60 sec -> 3600 rotations\n>\n>   1 sec -> 60 rotations\n>\n>   **Data transfer rate = number of rotations per second \\* track capacity \\* number of surfaces (since 1 R-W head is used for each surface)**\n>\n>   Data transfer rate = 60 \\* 128 \\* 256 \\* 4\n>\n>   Data transfer rate = 7.5 MB/sec\n>\n> **The disk is rotating at 3600 RPM, what is the average access time?**\n>\n> - Since seek time, controller time and the amount of data to be transferred is not given, we consider all three terms as 0.\n>\n>   Therefore, **Average Access time = Average rotational delay**\n>\n>   Rotational latency => 60 sec -> 3600 rotations\n>\n>   1 sec -> 60 rotations\n>\n>   Rotational latency = (1/60) sec = 16.67 msec.\n>\n>   Average Rotational latency = (16.67)/2\n>\n>   = 8.33 msec.\n>\n>   Average Access time = 8.33 msec.\n>\n> Another example: [GATE IT 2007 \\| Question 44](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gate-gate-it-2007-question-44/)\n\n## History of HDD\n\nThe hard disk was developed in 1953 by IBM developers who were looking for a solution to offer low-cost random access to large amounts of data. The first disk drives, which had a capacity of 3.75 MB and were the size of [refrigerators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/who-invented-refrigerator/), started to be shipped in 1956. Another early supplier of hard disk drive technology was Memorex, followed by Seagate Technology and Western Digital.\n\nThe size of hard disk drives has been getting smaller as technology has advanced. The 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch form factors were introduced and standardized in personal computers by the middle of the 1980s.\n\nThe storage capacity of latest hard disk drives is in the terabyte range, compared to the initial hard disk drives\u2019 capacity of megabytes. HGST, formerly known as Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, is a Western Digital brand released the first 1 TB hard drives in 2007. In 2015, HGST introduced the first 10 TB hard drive. And in 2021, Western Digital introduced two 20 TB HDDs.\n\n## Why do Computers Need Hard Disks?\n\nHard discs are used to install operating systems, programmes, and other storage devices, they are also used to save documents. Computer users would be unable to save their files or documents on their computers because HDD maintain data after being turning off of the computer. This is why every computer need at least one storage device to permanently save data for as long as it is needed.\n\n## How do Hard Disk Drives Work?\n\nMost basic hard drives are made up of numerous disk platters, which are circular disks composed of aluminum, glass, or ceramic that are arranged around a spindle inside a sealed chamber. The platter is spun by a motor attached to the spindle. The chamber also contains the read/write heads, which use a magnetic head to record information to and from tracks on the platters. The disks are additionally covered in a thin magnetic coating.\n\nThe platters rotate at up to 15,000 rotations per minute by the motor. A second motor regulates the location of the read and write heads that magnetically record and read information on each platter as the platters rotate. The compartments that store the data can be spread out all over the hard disk.\n\n## Hard Disk Drive Storage Capacity\n\n- Three storage options\u00a016 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB. This is one of the lowest [HDD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hdd-full-form/) storage space ranges and is often seen in older and smaller devices.\n- There are two sizes 120 GB and 256 GB. This category is commonly regarded as an entry level for HDD devices like as [laptops or desktops](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-desktop-and-laptop/) .\n- 500 GB, 1 TB, and 2 TB are available. HDD storage of 500 GB or more is often deemed adequate for the average user. With this much capacity, users can most certainly save all of their music, photos, videos, and other information. Individuals with large-file games should find 1 TB to 2 TB of HDD capacity adequate.\n- More than 2 TB of storage. Anything with more than 2 TB of HDD space is appropriate for users who work with high-resolution files.\n- Recently, the highest capacity of HDD is 20 TB.\n\n## Hard Disk Drive Components and Form Factors\n\n**HDD have below components:**\n\n- **Platters:** Magnetic platters are disk-like in shape and used to store data. Typically, they are made from glass or aluminum and laid down on a spindle where layers of such disks are kept one after the other.\n- **Spindle:** The spindle maintains the platters in place and rotates them as required. The Revolution Per Minute(RPM) rating controls how fast data can be written to and read from the hard drive.\n- **Actuator Arm:** The actuator, also known as the head actuator, is a tiny motor that controls the movement of the read/write haed and monitors data transfer between the platters. It is in charge of ensuring that the read/write heads are always in the proper direction.\n- **Read/write Head** : The read/write arm controls the movement of the read/write heads, that perform the actual reading and writing on the disc platters.\n\n**HDD have below form factors**:\n\n- **3.5 inches:** Among the drive types that are common for desktops, 3.5-inch is the most commonly used form factor, it represent the approximate diameter of the platter within the drive enclosures\n- **2.5 inches:** These are used in laptop and other portable device and they also used to represent the approximate diameter of the platter within the drive enclosures\n- **1.8 inches:** The 1.8-inch drives are generally employed in extremely light and thin devices like tablets and some MP3 players with large storage capacity\n- **Enterprise Form Factor:** Some HDDs are designed to be used in corporation environments and can are available larger form elements which includes 3.5-inch and a pair of.5-inch but with one-of-a-kind specs optimized for excessive-overall performance, reliability, and durability in server and garage structures.\n\n## Features of HDD\n\n- **Non-volatile:** HDD is a non-volatile memory device, which means that the data stored on it persists even when the power is turned off. This makes it an ideal storage medium for long-term data storage.\n- **High Capacity:** HDDs can store a large amount of data. Modern HDDs can store terabytes of data, making them an ideal choice for storing large files such as videos, photos, and audio recordings.\n- **Relatively Slow Speed:** Compared to primary memory devices such as [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-ram-random-access-memory/) , HDDs are relatively slow. The data access time for an HDD is typically measured in milliseconds, while the access time for RAM is measured in nanoseconds. This makes HDDs better suited for long-term storage rather than for frequently accessed data.\n- **Mechanical Parts:** Unlike [solid-state drives (SSDs)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-solid-state-drive-ssd/) , HDDs have mechanical parts that can wear out over time, leading to reduced performance or even failure. HDDs contain spinning disks and moving read/write heads, which can be susceptible to damage if the drive is bumped or dropped.\n- **Cost-effective:** HDDs are generally less expensive than SSDs, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious users. This is particularly true for larger capacity drives.\n- **Reliable:** While HDDs are not as reliable as SSDs due to their mechanical components, they are still considered to be a reliable storage medium. HDDs are designed to withstand heavy use and are often used in enterprise-level storage solutions.\n\n## Some Common HDD Errors\n\n- **Electrical Error:** If a hard disc powers on but cannot read or write data , one or more of its components has most likely failed electrically.\n- **Logical Failure:** Logical failure occurs when the hard disk\u2019s software is hacked or stops working properly. All types of data corruption may leads to logical failure.\n- **Disk Failure:** Disk failure occur when the hard disk is not working properly that may leads to data loss.\n- **Disk Full:** One more common issue is Disk full Issue that occur when there is no more space on the disk to store data.\n- **Bad Sector:** Bad sector failure occurs when the magnetic surface on a hard disk\u2019s platter is displaced, making a specific area of the platter inaccessible.\n- **Firmware Failure:** Firmware failure occurs when the software that performs maintenance duties on a disk becomes corrupted .\n\n## What are External HDDs?\n\nExternal hard drives can be used as a portable data backup device or to increase a computer\u2019s storage capacity. Through connectors like USB 2.0, [USB-C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/universal-serial-bus-usb-in-computer-network/), or External [SATA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sata-full-form/) (eSATA), external disks can be connected to a computer or other device. Additionally, compared to internal HDDs, external hard drives may transport data more slowly.\n\nIn addition to being able to increase a system storage capacity, an external hard drive also has the benefit of being portable. Users are able to physically carry their stored data on numerous devices with them wherever they go.\n\n## **Advantages of HDD**\n\n- **Capacity Limit:** HDDs offer enormous stockpiling limits contrasted with other auxiliary memory choices, making them appropriate for putting away immense measures of information, including media records, reports, and applications.\n- **Practical:** HDDs are by and large more savvy per unit of capacity contrasted with strong state drives (SSDs) and other fast stockpiling choices, pursuing them a favored decision for those requiring broad capacity without burning through every last cent.\n- **Mature Innovation:** HDDs have been around for quite a while, making them a deep rooted and solid innovation. They\u2019ve gone through various refinements and upgrades, coming about in vigorous, tried, and dependable capacity arrangements.\n- **Similarity:** HDDs are viable with most PCs and working frameworks, guaranteeing simplicity of coordination and use across various stages.\n- **Successive Read/Compose Execution:** In specific situations, especially with huge document moves or consecutive information access, HDDs can give fair read and compose speeds.\n- **Life span:** With legitimate consideration and support, HDDs can have a moderately lengthy life expectancy, making them reasonable for long haul stockpiling needs.\n- **Data Maintenance:** HDDs can hold information in any event, when controlled off, pursuing them a solid decision for putting away data for broadened periods.\n- **Information Recuperation:** at times, information recuperation from a faltering HDD can be conceivable utilizing specific devices and strategies, giving an opportunity to recover important data even from harmed drives.\n- **Steady Overhauls:** HDDs can be effectively updated or supplanted without broad specialized information. Clients can add more drives or supplant existing ones with bigger limits depending on the situation.\n- **Wide Accessibility:** HDDs are broadly accessible in different structure elements, sizes, and capacity limits, making them effectively available for different registering needs.\n\n## Disadvantages of HDD\n\n- For complex files HDD are slow.\n- HDD produce huge amount of head while working.\n- The mechanical part of Hard Disk Drive require more power to operate.\n- HDD are less durable for especially for portable device.\n- When HDD operates, it produces a lot of noise.\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Hard Disk Drive \u2013 FAQs\n\n### Why does a computer need a hard drive?\n\n> We use Hard Drive to install operating systems, programs, additional storage devices, and to save data. If we don\u2019t have hard disk in computer we are not able to save programs, files, or documents to their computers. HDD store data even after the computer is turn off.\n\n### What is a dynamic disk hard drive?\n\n> Dynamic disks hard drive manage data in a different way than traditional drives. Dynamic drives are more flexible and can store more data at a time, unlike traditional drives that might reserve a specific amount of space for the operating system.\n\n### What is stored on a hard drive?\n\n> A hard drive hold pictures, music, videos, text documents, and files. Hard drives also hold the files needed for the computer\u2019s operating system and software applications.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-solid-state-drive-ssd/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction to Solid-State Drive (SSD)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-solid-state-drive-ssd/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MohitMalhotra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[MohitMalhotra](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/MohitMalhotra/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n48\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Organization & Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-organization-architecture/?ref=article_category)\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Computer Fundamental Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nThis Computer Fundamental Tutorial covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, including computer hardware, software, operating systems, peripherals, etc. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, this tutorial is designed to enhance your computer skills and take them to the n\\\\\n\\\\\n7 min read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-fundamentals-tutorial/?ref=lbp)\n\n## Introduction To Computer Fundamentals\n\n- [What is Computer?\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA computer is an electronic device that can process and store information.

These algorithms help determine the order in which disk read and write requests are processed, significantly impacting the speed and efficiency of data access. Common disk scheduling methods include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK. By understanding and implementing these algorithms, we can optimize system performance and ensure faster data retrieval.\n\n- Disk scheduling is a technique operating systems use to manage the order in which disk I/O (input/output) requests are processed.\n- Disk scheduling is also known as I/O Scheduling.\n- The main goals of disk scheduling are to optimize the performance of disk operations, reduce the time it takes to access data and improve overall system efficiency.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the different types of disk scheduling algorithms and their functions. By understanding and implementing these algorithms, we can optimize system performance and ensure faster data retrieval.\n\n## Importance of Disk Scheduling in Operating System\n\n- Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.\n- Two or more requests may be far from each other so this can result in greater disk arm movement.\n- Hard drives are one of the slowest parts of the computer system and thus need to be accessed in an efficient manner.\n\n## Key Terms Associated with Disk Scheduling\n\n- **Seek Time:** Seek time is the time taken to locate the disk arm to a specified track where the data is to be read or written. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives a minimum average seek time is better.\n- **Rotational Latency:** Rotational Latency is the time taken by the desired sector of the disk to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum rotational latency is better.\n- **Transfer Time:** Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the rotating speed of the disk and the number of bytes to be transferred.\n- **Disk Access Time:**\n\n> Disk Access Time = Seek Time + Rotational Latency + Transfer Time\n>\n> Total Seek Time = Total head Movement \\* Seek Time\n\n![Disk Access Time and Disk Response Time](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/disc-scheduling-algorithms.png)\n\nDisk Access Time and Disk Response Time\n\n- **Disk Response Time:** Response Time is the average time spent by a request waiting to perform its I/O operation. The average _Response time_ is the response time of all requests. _Variance Response Time_ is the measure of how individual requests are serviced with respect to average response time. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum variance response time is better.\n\n## Goal of Disk Scheduling Algorithms\n\n- Minimize Seek Time\n- Maximize Throughput\n- Minimize Latency\n- Fairness\n- Efficiency in Resource Utilization\n\n## **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**\n\nThere are several Disk Several Algorithms. We will discuss in detail each one of them.\n\n- FCFS (First Come First Serve)\n- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)\n- SCAN\n- C-SCAN\n- LOOK\n- C-LOOK\n- RSS (Random Scheduling)\n- **LIFO (Last-In First-Out)**\n- **N-STEP SCAN**\n- F-SCAN\n\n### **1\\. FCFS (First Come First Serve)**\n\n[FCFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fcfs-disk-scheduling-algorithms) is the simplest of all Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue. Let us understand this with the help of an example.\n\n![First Come First Serve](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608201201/fcfs3.jpg)\n\nFirst Come First Serve\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose the order of request is- (82,170,43,140,24,16,190)\n\nAnd current position of Read/Write head is: 50\n\n```\nSo, total overhead movement \u00a0(total distance covered by the disk arm) =\n(82-50)+(170-82)+(170-43)+(140-43)+(140-24)+(24-16)+(190-16) =642\n```\n\n**Advantages of FCFS**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of First Come First Serve.\n\n- Every request gets a fair chance\n- No indefinite postponement\n\n**Disadvantages of FCFS**\n\nHere are some of the disadvantages of First Come First Serve.\n\n- Does not try to optimize seek time\n- May not provide the best possible service\n\n### **2\\. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**\n\nIn [SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-sstf-disk-scheduling-algorithm), requests having the shortest seek time are executed first. So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time. As a result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first. SSTF is certainly an improvement over FCFS as it decreases the average response time and increases the throughput of the system. Let us understand this with the help of an example.\n\n#### **Example:**\n\n![Shortest Seek Time First](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608201702/sstf1.jpg)\n\nShortest Seek Time First\n\nSuppose the order of request is- (82,170,43,140,24,16,190)\n\nAnd current position of Read/Write head is: 50\n\nSo,\n\n```\ntotal overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) =\n(50-43)+(43-24)+(24-16)+(82-16)+(140-82)+(170-140)+(190-170) =208\n\n```\n\n**Advantages of Shortest Seek Time First**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of Shortest Seek Time First.\n\n- The average Response Time decreases\n- Throughput increases\n\n**Disadvantages of Shortest Seek Time First**\n\nHere are some of the disadvantages of Shortest Seek Time First.\n\n- Overhead to calculate seek time in advance\n- Can cause Starvation for a request if it has a higher seek time as compared to incoming requests\n- The high variance of response time as SSTF favors only some requests\n\n### **3\\. SCAN**\n\nIn the [SCAN algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scan-elevator-disk-scheduling-algorithms) the disk arm moves in a particular direction and services the requests coming in its path and after reaching the end of the disk, it reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path. So, this algorithm works as an elevator and is hence also known as an **elevator algorithm.** As a result, the requests at the midrange are serviced more and those arriving behind the disk arm will have to wait.\n\n**Example:**\n\n![SCAN Algorithm](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202008/scan4.jpg)\n\nSCAN Algorithm\n\nSuppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move **\u201ctowards the larger value\u201d.**\n\nTherefore, the total overhead movement \u00a0(total distance covered by the disk arm) \u00a0is calculated as\n\n```\n= (199-50) + (199-16) = 332\n```\n\n**Advantages of SCAN Algorithm**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of the SCAN Algorithm.\n\n- High throughput\n- Low variance of response time\n- Average response time\n\n**Disadvantages of SCAN Algorithm**\n\nHere are some of the disadvantages of the SCAN Algorithm.\n\n- Long waiting time for requests for locations just visited by disk arm\n\n### **4\\. C-SCAN**\n\nIn the [SCAN algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-scan-disk-scheduling-algorithm), the disk arm again scans the path that has been scanned, after reversing its direction. So, it may be possible that too many requests are waiting at the other end or there may be zero or few requests pending at the scanned area.\n\nThese situations are avoided in the _CSCAN_ algorithm in which the disk arm instead of reversing its direction goes to the other end of the disk and starts servicing the requests from there. So, the disk arm moves in a circular fashion and this algorithm is also similar to the SCAN algorithm hence it is known as C-SCAN (Circular SCAN).\n\n#### **Example:**\n\n![Circular SCAN](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202230/cscan1.jpg)\n\nCircular SCAN\n\nSuppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move **\u201ctowards the larger value\u201d.**\n\nSo, the total overhead movement \u00a0(total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as:\n\n```\n=(199-50) + (199-0) + (43-0) = 391\n```\n\n**Advantages of C-SCAN Algorithm**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of C-SCAN.\n\n- Provides more uniform wait time compared to SCAN.\n\n### **5\\. LOOK**\n\n[LOOK Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/look-disk-scheduling-algorithm) is similar to the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm except for the difference that the disk arm in spite of going to the end of the disk goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses its direction from there only. Thus it prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.\n\n#### **Example:**\n\n![LOOK Algorithm](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202613/look1.jpg)\n\nLOOK Algorithm\n\nSuppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move **\u201ctowards the larger value\u201d.**\n\nSo, the total overhead movement \u00a0(total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as:\n\n```\n= (190-50) + (190-16) = 314\n```\n\n### **6\\. C-LOOK**\n\nAs LOOK is similar to the SCAN algorithm, in a similar way, [C-LOOK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-look-disk-scheduling-algorithm) is similar to the CSCAN disk scheduling algorithm. In CLOOK, the disk arm in spite of going to the end goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then from there goes to the other end\u2019s last request. Thus, it also prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.\n\n#### **Example:**\n\n1. Suppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move **\u201ctowards the larger value\u201d**\n\n![C-LOOK](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202846/clook1.jpg)\n\nC-LOOK\n\nSo, the total overhead movement \u00a0(total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as\n\n```\n= (190-50) + (190-16) + (43-16) = 341\n```\n\n### **7\\. RSS (Random Scheduling)**\n\nIt stands for Random Scheduling and just like its name it is natural. It is used in situations where scheduling involves random attributes such as random processing time, random due dates, random weights, and stochastic machine breakdowns this algorithm sits perfectly. Which is why it is usually used for analysis and simulation.\n\n### **8\\. LIFO (Last-In First-Out)**\n\nIn LIFO (Last In, First Out) algorithm, the newest jobs are serviced before the existing ones i.e. in order of requests that get serviced the job that is newest or last entered is serviced first, and then the rest in the same order.\n\n**Advantages of LIFO (Last-In First-Out)**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of the Last In First Out Algorithm.\n\n- Maximizes locality and resource utilization\n- Can seem a little unfair to other requests and if new requests keep coming in, it cause starvation to the old and existing ones.\n\n### **9\\. N-STEP SCAN**\n\nIt is also known as the [N-STEP LOOK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-step-scan-disk-scheduling) algorithm. In this, a buffer is created for N requests. All requests belonging to a buffer will be serviced in one go. Also once the buffer is full no new requests are kept in this buffer and are sent to another one. Now, when these N requests are serviced, the time comes for another top N request and this way all get requests to get a guaranteed service\n\n**Advantages of N-STEP SCAN**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of the N-Step Algorithm.\n\n- It eliminates the starvation of requests completely\n\n### **10\\. F-SCAN**\n\nThis algorithm uses two sub-queues. During the scan, all requests in the first queue are serviced and the new incoming requests are added to the second queue. All new requests are kept on halt until the existing requests in the first queue are serviced.\n\n**Advantages of F-SCAN**\n\nHere are some of the advantages of the [F-SCAN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fscan-disk-scheduling-algorithm) Algorithm.\n\n- F-SCAN along with N-Step-SCAN prevents \u201carm stickiness\u201d (phenomena in I/O scheduling where the scheduling algorithm continues to service requests at or near the current sector and thus prevents any seeking)\n\nEach algorithm is unique in its own way. Overall Performance depends on the number and type of requests.\n\n**Note: Average Rotational latency** is generally taken as 1/2(Rotational latency).\n\n## Questions For Practice\n\n**1\\. Suppose a disk has 201 cylinders, numbered from 0 to 200. At some time the disk arm is at cylinder 100, and there is a queue of disk access requests for cylinders 30, 85, 90, 100, 105, 110, 135, and 145. If Shortest-Seek Time First (SSTF) is being used for scheduling the disk access, the request for cylinder 90 is serviced after servicing \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ the number of requests.

Note that we have made a node class having 2 members. \u2018distance\u2019 is used to store the distance between the head and the track position. \u2018accessed\u2019 is a boolean variable that tells whether the track has been accessed/serviced before by the disk head or not.\n\n- C++\n- Java\n- Python3\n- C#\n- Javascript\n\n## C++\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `// C++ program for implementation of

It is a kind of buffering mechanism or a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program or the system. Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution.\n\n#### Need of Spooling\n\nPeripheral equipment such as printers and punch card readers are often slow relative to the performance of the rest of the system, creating a bottleneck in the I/O process. This is where spooling comes in. Spooling resolves this by accumulating data, instructions, and processes from multiple sources in a request queue, which is then processed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.\n\n#### How Does Spooling Work:\n\nSpooling can be implemented using the computer\u2019s physical memory, buffers, or device-specific interrupts. The most common applications of spooling are found in I/O devices like keyboards, printers, and mice. For example, when a document is sent to a printer, it is first stored in the printer\u2019s spooler or memory. When the printer is ready, it fetches the data from the spool and prints it.\n\nBatch processing systems also use spooling to maintain a queue of ready-to-run jobs, which can be started as soon as the system has the resources to process them. Additionally, spooling is capable of overlapping I/O operation for one job with processor operations for another job, allowing multiple processes to write documents to a print queue without waiting and resume with their work.\n\n**Applications/Implementations of Spool:**\n\n1) The most common can be found in I/O devices like keyboard printers and mouse. For example, In printer, the documents/files that are sent to the printer are first stored in the memory or the printer spooler. Once the printer is ready, it fetches the data from the spool and prints it.\n\nEver experienced a situation when suddenly for some seconds your mouse or keyboard stops working? Meanwhile, we usually click again and again here and there on the screen to check if its working or not. When it actually starts working, what and wherever we pressed during its hang state gets executed very fast because all the instructions got stored in the respective device\u2019s spool.\n\n2) A batch processing system uses spooling to maintain a queue of ready-to-run jobs which can be started as soon as the system has the resources to process them.\n\n3) Spooling is capable of overlapping I/O operation for one job with processor operations for another job. i.e. multiple processes can write documents to a print queue without waiting and resume with their work.\n\n4) E-mail: an email is delivered by a MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) to a temporary storage area where it waits to be picked up by the MA (Mail User Agent)\n\n5) Can also be used for generating Banner pages (these are the pages used in computerized printing in order to separate documents from each other and to identify e.g. the originator of the print request by username, an account number or a bin for pickup. Such pages are used in office environments where many people share the small number of available resources).\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nEkta is a \u00a0very active contributor on Geeksforgeeks.

Two ways by which Input/output subsystems can improve the computer\u2019s performance and efficiency by using memory space in the main memory or on the disk are _spooling and buffering_. These are two techniques widely used to handle data between devices, processes, and memory. To optimize system performance, we need to understand their differences is essential.\n\n## Spooling\n\nSpooling stands for **Simultaneous peripheral operation online**. It is a special process in a special area on disk where data is temporarily stored and queued for execution. A spool is similar to a buffer as it holds the jobs for a device until the device is ready to accept the job. It considers the disk as a huge buffer that can store as many jobs for the device till the output devices are ready to accept them. Multiple tasks are handled simultaneously by using this technique. It is commonly used in a scenario like printing, where documents are arranged or stored in a queue and sent to the [printer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printer-spooler-problem/) sequentially.\n\n![spooling](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240828132149/spoolimg-gfg.jpg)\n\n### Advantages of Spooling\n\n- **Management of Resources:** means when there are tasks in queue then the resources must be utilized fully without idle time.\n- **Improved Efficiency:** Spooling helps to increase overall system [throughput](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bandwidth-and-throughput/) by allowing multiple jobs to be processed concurrently.\n- **Data Integrity:** by queuing the tasks spooling helps the data to be processed in the correct sequence, reducing chances of errors.\n\n### Disadvantages of Spooling\n\n- **Disk Space Usage:** In spooling we need to queue the data and for this disk space is required to store the queued data, and which can cause resource constraints in limited environments.\n- **Delay in Processing:** If the number of jobs increases, and the system may not able to handle these jobs and the load efficiently then the tasks might experience delays.\n\n## **Buffering**\n\nThe [main memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/) has an area called buffer that is used to store or hold the data temporarily that is being transmitted either between two devices or between a device or an application. Buffering is an act of storing data temporarily in the buffer. It helps in matching the speed of the data stream between the sender and the receiver. If the speed of the sender\u2019s transmission is slower than the receiver, then a buffer is created in the main memory of the receiver, and it accumulates the bytes received from the sender and vice versa.\n\n![buffering](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240828132230/buffering-gfg.jpg)\n\n### Advantages of Buffering\n\n- **Matching the Speed:** It accommodates speed differences between devices, also reduce the chances of bottlenecks by allowing smoother data transfer.\n- **Minimized Latency:** In buffering we don\u2019t need to wait for the source and destination to catch up for the data to be processed or transmitted, it reduces latency.\n- **Better User Experience:** In media streaming the data is preloaded, so that video is consistent while video is playing.\n\n### Disadvantage of Buffering\n\n- **Memory Consumption:** It needs memory allocation and this can be a limitation for different systems as some systems are with limited resources as well.\n- **Potential Data Loss:** In real-time application there is a chance of loosing data or corrupting of data if the buffer overflows.\n\n## **Differences Between Spooling and Buffering**\n\n- The basic difference between Spooling and Buffering is that Spooling overlaps the input/output of one job with the execution of another job while the buffering overlaps the input/output of one job with the execution of the same job.\n- The key difference between spooling and buffering is that Spooling can handle the input/output of one job along with the computation of another job at the same time while buffering handles input/output of one job along with its computation.\n- Spooling stands for Simultaneous Peripheral Operation online. Whereas buffering is not an acronym.\n- Spooling is more efficient than buffering, as spooling can overlap processing two jobs at a time.\n- Buffering uses limited area in main memory while Spooling uses the disk as a huge buffer.\n\n|  | Spooling | Buffering |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Difference | It overlap the input/output of one job with the execution of another job. | It overlaps the input/output of one job with the execution of the same job. |\n| Full form (stands for) | Simultaneous peripheral operation online | No full form |\n| Efficiency | Spooling is more efficient than buffering | buffering is less efficient than spooling. |\n| Consider Size | It consider disk as a huge spool or buffer. | Buffer is limited area in main memory. |\n| remote processing | It can process data at remote places. | It does not support remote processing. |\n| Implementation | Implemented using spoolers which manage input/output requests and allocate resources as needed | Implemented through software or hardware-based mechanisms such as circular buffers or [FIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-principle-of-queue/) queues |\n| Capacity | Can handle large amounts of data since spooled data is stored on disk or other external storage | Limited by the size of memory available for buffering. |\n| Error handling | Since data is stored on external storage, spooling can help recover from system crashes or other errors | Error can occur if buffer overflow happens, which can cause data loss or corruption. |\n| Complexity | More complex than buffering since spooling requires additional software to manage input/output requests. | Less complex than spooling since buffering is a simpler technique for managing data transfer. |\n\n## **Difference Between Spooling and Buffering \u2013 FAQs**\n\n### **Why is buffering important in media streaming?**\n\n> Because it helps to maintain the smooth playback experience by already loading the data and compensating for network fluctuations.\n\n### **What is more efficient among them, spooling or buffering?**\n\n> It depends on the use cases. Both were efficient but in different scenarios, like Spooling is more efficient for managing multiple tasks, while buffering is better for handling data transfer between devices with varying speeds.\n\n### **Can both spooling and buffering be used together?**\n\n> Yes, both can be used together, where both tasks need to managed and data transfer needs to optimized is required like in complex systems.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-buffering-and-caching-in-os/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Difference Between Buffering and Caching in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-buffering-and-caching-in-os/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit_Bisht/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Ankit\\_Bisht](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Ankit_Bisht/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n34\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Difference Between](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/difference-between/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Difference between Spooling and Buffering\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn computing, efficient management is crucial when processing data or transmitting it.

The operating system uses various techniques to manage free space and optimize the use of storage devices. Here are some of the commonly used free space management techniques:\n\n## Free Space Management Techniques\n\n- **Linked Allocation:** In this technique, each file is represented by a linked list of disk blocks. When a file is created, the operating system finds enough free space on the disk and links the blocks of the file to form a chain. This method is simple to implement but can lead to fragmentation and waste of space.\n- **Contiguous Allocation:** In this technique, each file is stored as a contiguous block of disk space. When a file is created, the operating system finds a contiguous block of free space and assigns it to the file. This method is efficient as it minimizes fragmentation but suffers from the problem of external fragmentation.\n- **Indexed Allocation:** In this technique, a separate index block is used to store the addresses of all the disk blocks that make up a file. When a file is created, the operating system creates an index block and stores the addresses of all the blocks in the file. This method is efficient in terms of storage space and minimizes fragmentation.\n- **File Allocation Table (FAT):** In this technique, the operating system uses a file allocation table to keep track of the location of each file on the disk. When a file is created, the operating system updates the file allocation table with the address of the disk blocks that make up the file. This method is widely used in Microsoft Windows operating systems.\n- **Volume Shadow Copy:** This is a technology used in [Microsoft Windows operating systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-windows-operating-system/) to create backup copies of files or entire volumes. When a file is modified, the operating system creates a shadow copy of the file and stores it in a separate location. This method is useful for data recovery and protection against accidental file deletion.\n\nOverall, free space management is a crucial function of operating systems, as it ensures that storage devices are utilized efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe system keeps tracks of the free disk blocks for allocating space to files when they are created. Also, to reuse the space released from deleting the files, free space management becomes crucial. The system maintains a free space list which keeps track of the disk blocks that are not allocated to some file or directory. The free space list can be implemented mainly as:\n\n## **1\\. Bitmap or Bit vector**\n\nA [Bitmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitmap-indexing-in-dbms/) or Bit Vector is series or collection of bits where each bit corresponds to a disk block. The bit can take two values: 0 and 1: _0 indicates that the block is free_ and 1 indicates an allocated _\u200b_ block. The given instance of disk blocks on the disk in _Figure 1_ (where green blocks are allocated) can be represented by a bitmap of 16 bits as: **1111000111111001**. ![Bitmap or Bit vector](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1-265.png)\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Simple to understand.\n- Finding the first free block is efficient. It requires scanning the words (a group of 8 bits) in a bitmap for a non-zero word. (A 0-valued word has all bits 0). The first free block is then found by scanning for the first 1 bit in the non-zero word.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- For finding a free block, Operating System needs to iterate all the blocks which is time consuming.\n- The efficiency of this method reduces as the disk size increases.\n\n## **2\\. Linked List**\n\nIn this approach, the free disk blocks are linked together i.e. a free block contains a pointer to the next free block. The block number of the very first disk block is stored at a separate location on disk and is also cached in memory. ![Linked List](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2-190.png)In _Figure-2_, the free space list head points to Block 5 which points to Block 6, the next free block and so on. The last free block would contain a null pointer indicating the end of free list. A drawback of this method is the I/O required for free space list traversal.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- The total available space is used efficiently using this method.\n- Dynamic allocation in Linked List is easy, thus can add the space as per the requirement dynamically.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n- When the size of Linked List increases, the headache of miniating pointers is also increases.\n- This method is not efficient during iteration of each block of memory.\n\n## **Grouping**\n\nThis approach stores the address of the free blocks in the first free block. The first free block stores the address of some, say n free blocks. Out of these n blocks, the first n-1 blocks are actually free and the last block contains the address of next free n blocks. An **advantage** of this approach is that the addresses of a group of free disk blocks can be found easily.\n\n**Advantage:**\n\n- Finding free blocks in massive amount can be done easily using this method.\n\n**Disadvantage:**\n\n- The only disadvantage is, we need to alter the entire list, if any of the block of the list is occupied.\n\n## **Counting**\n\nThis approach stores the address of the first free disk block and a number n of free contiguous disk blocks that follow the first block. Every entry in the list would contain:\n\n- Address of first free disk block.\n- A number n.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- Using this method, a group of entire free blocks can take place easily and Fastly.\n- The list formed in this method is especially smaller in size.\n\n**Disadvantage:**\n\n- The first free block in this method, keeps account of other free blocks. Thus, due to that one block the space requirement is more.\n\n## Advantages of Free Space Management Techniques\n\n- **Efficient Use of Storage Space:** Free space management techniques help to optimize the use of storage space on the [hard disk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hard-disk-drive-hdd-secondary-memory/) or other secondary storage devices.\n- **Easy to Implement:** Some techniques, such as linked allocation, are simple to implement and require less overhead in terms of processing and memory resources.\n- **Faster Access to Files**: Techniques such as contiguous allocation can help to reduce disk fragmentation and improve access time to files.\n\n## Disadvantages of Free Space Management Techniques\n\n- **Fragmentation:** Techniques such as linked allocation can lead to fragmentation of disk space, which can decrease the efficiency of storage devices.\n- **Overhead**: Some techniques, such as indexed allocation, require additional overhead in terms of memory and processing resources to maintain index blocks.\n- **Limited scalability**: Some techniques, such as FAT, have limited scalability in terms of the number of files that can be stored on the disk.\n- **Risk of data loss**: In some cases, such as with contiguous allocation, if a file becomes corrupted or damaged, it may be difficult to recover the data.\n- Overall, the choice of free space management technique depends on the specific requirements of the [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) and the storage devices being used. While some techniques may offer advantages in terms of efficiency and speed, they may also have limitations and drawbacks that need to be considered.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFree space management in an operating system ensures that storage is efficiently utilized and accessible for new data. It involves tracking which parts of the storage are free and which are occupied. Key methods include bitmaps, linked lists, and free space lists. Effective free space management helps maintain system performance, reduces [fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/), and ensures that applications have the space they need to function properly. By efficiently managing free space, an operating system can prevent storage-related issues and improve overall system reliability.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Free Space Management \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Why is free space management important?**\n\n> It\u2019s important because it helps the operating system use storage space efficiently, prevents fragmentation, and ensures that there is always enough space for new files and applications.\n\n### **What are the common methods of free space management?**\n\n> Common methods include bitmaps, linked lists, grouping and counting.\n\n### **How does a linked list help in free space management?**\n\n> A linked list keeps track of free blocks by linking them together.

Memory is divided into cells, and they are stored in the storage space present in the computer. Every cell has its unique location/address. Memory is very essential for a computer as this is the way it becomes somewhat more similar to a human brain. In this article, we are going to discuss memory and memory units in detail.\n\n## What is Memory?\n\nMemory devices are [digital systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-digital-systems/) that store data either temporarily or for a long term. Digital computers to hard disks have built-in memory devices that can store the data of users or manufacturers. The [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) either be in the form of control programs or programs that boot the system. Hence, to store such a huge amount of data the memory devices must have enormous capacity. The challenge is to build memory devices that have large capacities but are cost-effective. The memory devices must be capable of storing both permanent data and instantaneous data.\n\nMemories are made up of registers. Each register in the [memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-memory/) is one storage location. The storage location is also called a memory location. Memory locations are identified using Address. The total number of bits a memory can store is its capacity.\u00a0 A storage element is called a Cell. Each register is made up of a storage element in which one bit of data is stored.\n\nThe data in a memory are stored and retrieved by the process called [writing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-and-write-operations-in-memory/) and [reading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-and-write-operations-in-memory/) respectively.\n\n![Write & Read Operation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Read-and-write.png)\n\n- A word is a group of bits where a memory unit stores binary information. A word with a group of 8 bits is called a byte.\n\n- A memory unit consists of data lines, address selection lines, and control lines that specify the direction of transfer.\n\nThe block diagram of a memory unit is shown below:\n\n![Memory Units](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/memory-unit.png)\n\nData lines provide the information to be stored in memory. The control inputs specify the direct transfer. The k-address lines specify the word chosen.\n\nWhen there are k address lines, 2k memory words can be accessed.\n\n## Types of Computer Memory\n\n- **Cache Memory:** This temporary storage area, known as a\u00a0cache, is more readily available to the processor than the computer\u2019s main memory source. It is also called\u00a0_CPU memory_\u00a0because it is typically integrated directly into the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip with a\u00a0bus\u00a0interconnect with the CPU.\n\n- **RAM:** It is one of the parts of the Main memory, also famously known as Read Write Memory. Random Access memory is present on the motherboard and the computer\u2019s data is temporarily stored in [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/). As the name says, RAM can help in both Read and write.\n\n- **D RAM (Dynamic RAM):**\u00a0D RAM\u00a0uses capacitors and transistors and stores the data as a charge on the capacitors. They contain thousands of memory cells. It needs refreshing of charge on capacitor after a few milliseconds. This memory is slower than S RAM.\n\n- **S RAM (Static RAM):**\u00a0S RAM\u00a0uses transistors and the circuits of this memory are capable of retaining their state as long as the power is applied. This memory consists of the number of flip flops with each flip flop storing 1 bit. It has less access time and hence, it is faster.\n\n- **ROM:** ROM full form is Read Only Memory. ROM is a non volatile memory and it is used to store important information which is used to operate the system. We can only read the programs and data stored on it and can not modify of delete it.\n\n- **MROM(Masked ROM):** Hard-wired devices with a pre-programmed collection of data or instructions were the first ROMs. Masked ROMs are a type of low-cost ROM that works in this way.\n\n- **PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory):**\u00a0This read-only memory is modifiable once by the user. The user purchases a blank PROM and uses a\u00a0PROM\u00a0program to put the required contents into the PROM. Its content can\u2019t be erased once written.\n\n- **EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):**\u00a0EPROM\u00a0is an extension to PROM where you can erase the content of ROM by exposing it to Ultraviolet rays for nearly 40 minutes.\n\n- **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):** Here the written contents can be erased electrically. You can delete and reprogram\u00a0EEPROM\u00a0up to 10,000 times. Erasing and programming take very little time, i.e., nearly \u00a04 -10ms(milliseconds). Any area in an EEPROM can be wiped and programmed selectively.\n\n- **Virtual memory:**\u00a0A memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory. [Virtual memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) uses hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk storage.\n\n## **What is Primary Memory?**\n\nIt is also referred to as main memory or internal memory.

It is used to store instructions and process data. The memory comprises a large array or group of words or bytes, each with its own location. The primary purpose of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, along with the information they access, should be in the main memory during execution. The CPU fetches instructions from memory according to the value of the program counter.\n\nTo achieve a degree of multiprogramming and proper utilization of memory, memory management is important. Many memory management methods exist, reflecting various approaches, and the effectiveness of each algorithm depends on the situation.\n\nBefore we start Memory management, let us know what is main memory is.\n\n## What is Main Memory?\n\nThe main memory is central to the operation of a Modern Computer. Main Memory is a large array of words or bytes, ranging in size from hundreds of thousands to billions. Main memory is a repository of rapidly available information shared by the [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/) and I/O devices. Main memory is the place where programs and information are kept when the processor is effectively utilizing them. [Main memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-memory/) is associated with the processor, so moving instructions and information into and out of the processor is extremely fast. \u00a0Main memory is also known as [RAM (Random Access Memory)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/). This memory is volatile. RAM loses its data when a power interruption occurs.\n\n![Main Memory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221116104505/1white-660x453.png)\n\nMain Memory\n\n## What is Memory Management?\n\nMemory management mostly involves management of main memory. In a multiprogramming computer, the [Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) resides in a part of the main memory, and the rest is used by multiple processes. The task of subdividing the memory among different processes is called Memory Management. Memory management is a method in the operating system to manage operations between main memory and disk during process execution. The main aim of memory management is to achieve efficient utilization of memory.\n\n## Why Memory Management is Required?\n\n- Allocate and de-allocate memory before and after process execution.\n- To keep track of used memory space by processes.\n- To minimize [fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-external-fragmentation/) issues.\n- To proper utilization of main memory.\n- To maintain data integrity while executing of process.\n\nread more about \u2013 [Requirements of Memory Management System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/requirements-of-memory-management-system/)\n\nNow we are discussing the concept of [Logical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) Space and [Physical Address Space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)\n\n## Logical and Physical Address Space\n\n- **Logical Address Space:** An address generated by the CPU is known as a \u201cLogical Address\u201d. It is also known as a Virtual address.\u00a0Logical address space can be defined as the size of the process. A logical address can be changed.\n\n- **Physical Address Space:** An address seen by the memory unit (i.e. the one loaded into the memory address register of the memory) is commonly known as a \u201cPhysical Address\u201d. A Physical address is also known as a Real address. The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is known as Physical address space. A [physical address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) is computed by MMU. The run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by a hardware device Memory Management Unit(MMU). The physical address always remains constant.\n\n## Static and Dynamic Loading\n\nLoading a process into the main memory is done by a loader. There are two different types of loading :\n\n- **Static Loading:** Static Loading is basically loading the entire program into a fixed address. It requires more memory space.\n\n- **Dynamic Loading:** The entire program and all data of a process must be in physical memory for the process to execute. So, the size of a process is limited to the size of [physical memory.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) To gain proper memory utilization, dynamic loading is used. In [dynamic loading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-loading-and-linking/), a routine is not loaded until it is called. All routines are residing on disk in a [relocatable](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-allocation-techniques-mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/) load format. One of the advantages of dynamic loading is that the unused [routine](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-routine-and-process/) is never loaded. This loading is useful when a large amount of code is needed to handle it efficiently.\n\n## Static and Dynamic Linking\n\nTo perform a linking task a linker is used. A linker is a program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file.\n\n- **Static Linking:** In [static linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/), the linker combines all necessary program modules into a single executable program. So there is no runtime dependency. Some operating systems support only static linking, in which system language libraries are treated like any other object module.\n\n- **Dynamic Linking:** The basic concept of dynamic linking is similar to dynamic loading. In [dynamic linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/), \u201cStub\u201d is included for each appropriate library routine reference. A stub is a small piece of code. When the stub is executed, it checks whether the needed routine is already in memory or not. If not available then the program loads the routine into memory.\n\n## Swapping\n\nWhen a process is executed it must have resided in memory. [Swapping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swapping-in-operating-system/) is a process of swapping a process temporarily into a secondary memory from the main memory, which is fast compared to secondary memory. A swapping allows more processes to be run and can be fit into memory at one time. The main part of swapping is transferred time and the total time is directly proportional to the amount of [memory swapped](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/). Swapping is also known as roll-out, or roll because if a higher priority process arrives and wants service, the memory manager can swap out the lower priority process and then load and execute the higher priority process. After finishing higher priority work, the lower priority process swapped back in memory and continued to the execution process.\n\n![swapping in memory management](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20221116104533/2white-660x441.png)\n\nswapping in memory management\n\n## Memory Management Techniques\n\nMemory management techniques are methods used by an operating system to efficiently allocate, utilize, and manage memory resources for processes. These techniques ensure smooth execution of programs and optimal use of system memory\n\nDifferent Memory Management techniques are:\n\n![memory_management_techniques](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250111161309142776/memory_management_techniques.webp)\n\n## **Memory Management with Monoprogramming (Without Swapping)**\n\nThis is the simplest memory management approach the memory is divided into two sections:\n\n- One part of the operating system\n- The second part of the user program\n\n| **Fence Register** |\n| --- |\n| operating system | user program |\n\n- In this approach, the operating system keeps track of the first and last location available for the allocation of the user program\n- The operating system is loaded either at the bottom or at top\n- Interrupt vectors are often loaded in low memory therefore, it makes sense to load the operating system in low memory\n- Sharing of data and code does not make much sense in a single process environment\n- The Operating system can be protected from user programs with the help of a fence register.\n\n### **Multiprogramming with Fixed Partitions (Without Swapping)**\n\n- A memory partition scheme with a fixed number of partitions was introduced to support multiprogramming. this scheme is based on contiguous allocation\n- Each partition is a block of contiguous memory\n- Memory is partitioned into a fixed number of partitions.\n- Each partition is of fixed size\n\n**Example:** As shown in fig. memory is partitioned into 5 regions the region is reserved for updating the system the remaining four partitions are for the user program.\n\n**Fixed Size Partitioning**\n\n| Operating System |\n| --- |\n| p1 |\n| p2 |\n| p3 |\n| p4 |\n\n**Partition Table**\n\nOnce partitions are defined operating system keeps track of the status of \u00a0memory partitions it is done through a data structure called a partition table.\n\n**Sample Partition Table**\n\n| **Starting Address of Partition** | **Size of Partition** | **Status** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0k | 200k | allocated |\n| 200k | 100k | free |\n| 300k | 150k | free |\n| 450k | 250k | allocated |\n\n### **Logical vs Physical Address**\n\nAn address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a logical address. the address seen by the memory unit is known as the physical address. The logical address can be mapped to a physical address by hardware with the help of a base register this is known as dynamic relocation of memory references.\n\n## **Contiguous \u00a0Memory Allocation**\n\nContiguous memory allocation is a memory management method where each process is given a single, continuous block of memory. This means all the data for a process is stored in adjacent memory locations.\n\n![contiguous_memory_allocation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250113101849093610/contiguous_memory_allocation.webp)\n\nread more about \u2013 [Contiguous Memory Management Techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-of-contiguous-memory-management-techniques/)\n\n## Partition Allocation Methods\n\nTo gain proper memory utilization, memory allocation must be allocated efficient manner. One of the simplest methods for allocating memory is to divide memory into several fixed-sized partitions and each partition contains exactly one process. Thus, the degree of multiprogramming is obtained by the number of partitions.\n\n- **Fixed partition allocation:** Memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions during system initialization. Each partition can hold only one process.\n\n- **Dynamic Partition Allocation:** In this allocation strategy,Memory is divided into variable-sized partitions based on the size of the processes.\n\nWhen it is time to load a process into the main memory and if there is more than one free block of memory of sufficient size then the OS decides which free block to allocate.\n\nThere are different Placement Algorithm:\n\n1. First Fit\n2. Best Fit\n3. Worst Fit\n4. Next Fit\n\n- read more about \u2013 [Fixed (or static) Partitioning in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fixed-or-static-partitioning-in-operating-system/)\n\n- read more about \u2013 [Variable (or Dynamic) Partitioning in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-or-dynamic-partitioning-in-operating-system/)\n\n- read more about \u2013 [Partition Allocation Methods in Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-allocation-methods-in-memory-management/)\n\n# Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation\n\nNon-contiguous memory allocation is a memory management method where a process is divided into smaller parts, and these parts are stored in different, non-adjacent memory locations. This means the entire process does not need to be stored in one continuous block of memory.\n\nTechniques of Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation are:\n\n- [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)\n\n- [Segmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmentation-in-operating-system/)\n\nread more about \u2013 [Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/non-contiguous-allocation-in-operating-system/)\n\n## Fragmentation\n\nFragmentation is defined as when the process is loaded and removed after execution from memory, it creates a small free hole. These holes can not be assigned to new processes because holes are not combined or do not fulfill the memory requirement of the process. In the operating systems two types of fragmentation are:\n\n- **Internal fragmentation:** Internal fragmentation occurs when memory blocks are allocated to the process more than their requested size. Due to this some unused space is left over and creating an internal fragmentation problem. **Example:** Suppose there is a fixed partitioning used for memory allocation and the different sizes of blocks 3MB, 6MB, and 7MB space in memory. Now a new process p4 of size 2MB comes and demands a block of memory. It gets a memory block of 3MB but 1MB block of memory is a waste, and it can not be allocated to other processes too. This is called internal fragmentation.\n\n- **External fragmentation:** In External Fragmentation, we have a free memory block, but we can not assign it to a process because blocks are not contiguous. **Example:** Suppose (consider the above example) three processes p1, p2, and p3 come with sizes 2MB, 4MB, and 7MB respectively. Now they get memory blocks of size 3MB, 6MB, and 7MB allocated respectively. After allocating the process p1 process and the p2 process left 1MB and 2MB. Suppose a new process p4 comes and demands a 3MB block of memory, which is available, but we can not assign it because free memory space is not contiguous. \u00a0This is called external fragmentation.\n\nread more about \u2013 [Fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/)\n\n## Frequently asked Questions on Memory Management in Operating System \u2013 FAQ\n\n### What is a memory leak, and how does it affect system performance?\n\n> A memory leak occurs when a program fails to release memory that it no longer needs, resulting in wasted memory resources. Over time, if memory leaks accumulate, the system\u2019s available memory diminishes, leading to reduced performance and possibly system crashes.\n\n### Can memory fragmentation be prevented in an operating system?\n\n> While it is challenging to completely eliminate memory fragmentation, certain techniques can help minimize its impact. One approach is to use memory allocation algorithms that focus on reducing external fragmentation, such as buddy systems or slab allocation. Additionally, techniques like compaction can be employed to reduce internal fragmentation.\n\n### What are the advantages and disadvantages of using virtual memory?\n\n> Virtual memory provides several benefits, including the ability to run larger programs than the available physical memory, increased security through memory isolation, and simplified memory management for applications. However, using virtual memory also introduces additional overhead due to page table lookups and potential performance degradation if excessive swapping occurs.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-of-contiguous-memory-management-techniques/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Implementation of Contiguous Memory Management Techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-of-contiguous-memory-management-techniques/?ref=next_article)\n\n[V](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/varshachoudhary/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[varshachoudhary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/varshachoudhary/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n125\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems-Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/operating-systems-memory-management/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Operating System Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAn Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.

The buddy system is a memory allocation and management technique that uses power-of-two increments. In this article, we are going to discuss the Buddy System in detail along with examples, advantages, disadvantages, etc.\n\n## What is the Buddy System?\n\nBuddy System is a memory allocation technique used in computer OS to allocate and manage memory efficiently. This technique by dividing the memory into fixed-size blocks, and whenever a process requests memory, the system finds the smallest available block that can accommodate the requested memory size.\n\nIt splits memory blocks, called \u201cbuddies,\u201d to minimize fragmentation and ensure efficient allocation. When a process is deallocated, its buddy can be merged back into a larger block, reducing wasted space.\n\nThe Buddy System is a reminiscence control method utilized in working systems to [allocate memory dynamically](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/). It is by and large applied in systems wherein reminiscence is allocated and deallocated frequently, inclusive in multitasking environments or structures with varying memory demands. In the Buddy System, the memory is split into fixed-length blocks, regularly in powers of (e.g., 1KB, 2KB, 4KB, and so on.). When a request for memory allocation is made, the device seems for the correct-sized block. If an appropriate block is determined, it\u2019s far allocated to the inquiring manner. However, if the asked size doesn\u2019t shape any existing block precisely, the device allocates a bigger block after which splits it into smaller blocks till an accurately sized one is received.\n\n## Types of Buddy System\n\nThe Buddy System in memory control generally refers to a selected method used to allocate and deallocate memory blocks. However, within this framework, versions or adaptations may additionally exist relying on specific necessities or optimizations wished for distinctive structures. Here are a few types of Buddy Systems:\n\n- **Fibonacci Buddy System** : A Fibonacci buddy system has block sizes of 16, 32, 48, 80, 128, and 208 bytes, with each block size equal to the total of the two blocks previous it. When a block is divided from one free list, its two portions are added to the two free lists that came before it. It can be minimized by bringing the allowable block sizes close together. Now, let\u2019s look at an example to better grasp the Fibonacci buddy system. Assume the memory size is 377 kb. Then, 377 kb will be partitioned into 144 kb and 233 kb. Following that, 144 will be divided into (55 + 89), whereas 233 will be divided into (89 + 144). This separation will continue based on memory requirements.\n\n- **Binary Buddy System** : The buddy system keeps track of the free blocks of each size (known as a free list) so that you can easily discover a block of the necessary size if one is available. If no blocks of the requested size are available, Allocate examines the first non-empty list for blocks of at least the requested size. In both cases, a block is deleted from the free list. For ex: The 512 KB memory size is initially partitioned into two active partitions of 256 KB each, with additional subdivisions based on a capacity of 2 to handle memory requests.\n\n- **Weighted Buddy System:** In a weighted peer system, each memory block is associated with a weight, which represents its size relative to other blocks. When a memory allocation request occurs, the system searches for the appropriate block considering the size of the requested memory and the weight of the available blocks.\n\n- **Tertiary Buddy System** : In a traditional buddy system, memory is divided into blocks of fixed size, usually a power of 2, and allocated to these blocks but the tertiary buddy system introduces a third memory structure, which allows flexibility large in [memory allocation.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)\n\n## Algorithm of Buddy System Memory Allocation Technique\n\nBelow are the steps involved in the Buddy System Memory Allocation Technique:\n\n- The first step includes the division of memory into fixed-sized blocks that have a power of 2 in size (such as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. ).\n- Each block is labeled with its size and unique identification.\n- Initially, all the memory blocks are free and are linked together in a binary tree structure, with each node representing a block and the tree\u2019s leaves representing the smallest available blocks.\n- When a process requests memory, the system finds the smallest available block that can accommodate the requested size. If the block is larger than the requested size, the system splits the block into two equal-sized \u201cbuddy\u201d blocks.\n- The system marks one of the buddy blocks as allocated and adds it to the process\u2019s memory allocation table, while the other buddy block is returned to the free memory pool and linked back into the binary tree structure.\n- When a process releases memory, the system marks the corresponding block as free and looks for its buddy block. If the buddy block is also free, the system merges the two blocks into a larger block and links it back into the binary tree structure.\n\nThe Buddy System technique has several advantages, including efficient use of memory, [reduced fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/), and fast allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as internal fragmentation, where a block may be larger than what the process requires, leading to a waste of memory. Overall, the Buddy System is a useful memory allocation technique in operating systems, particularly for embedded systems with limited memory.\n\n> Let the memory size be 2u and a size S is required.\n>\n> - **If 2** ****U-1**** **<S<=2** ****U**** **:** Allocate the whole block\n> - **Else:** Recursively divide the block equally and test the condition at each time, when it satisfies, allocate the block and get out of the loop.\n\nThe system also keeps a record of all the unallocated blocks and can merge these different-sized blocks to make one big chunk.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the implementation of buddy system, considering a 1024k (1-megabyte) initial block and the process requests as shown at the left of the table.\n\n![buddy_system](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250113110644472883/buddy_system.webp)\n\nRequests should be handled in first come first serve basis. After all requests are processed, the program should show the current state of the buddy system, which indicates processes are using memory and which blocks are available. When a request is made for a block of size **s**, the program should assign the block of that size that was freed most recently.\n\nwhen a block is split in two, the left-one (lower addresses) should be selected before the right-one.\n\n### **Example of Buddy system**\n\nConsider a system having buddy system with physical address space 128 KB. Calculate the size of partition for 18 KB process.\n\n**Solution:**![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Capture-34.png) So, size of partition for 18 KB process = 32 KB. It divides by 2, till possible to get minimum block to fit 18 KB.\n\n## Features of Buddy System\n\n- **Scalability:** The Buddy System can scale nicely with growing memory demands. It can manage huge quantities of memory efficiently by means of dividing it into smaller blocks and dynamically adjusting block sizes based totally on allocation and deallocation styles.\n\n- **Efficient Splitting and Merging:** The Buddy System ensures that memory blocks are split and merged effectively. When a block is allotted, it\u2019s divided into smaller pal blocks. Conversely, when memory is deallocated, the gadget tests if the friend of the deallocated block is also free. If so, they\u2019re merged back into a larger block.\n\n- **Reduced Fragmentation:** By correctly splitting and merging reminiscence blocks, the Buddy System enables reduce memory fragmentation. [Fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/) occurs whilst memory is allotted and deallocated in a manner that leaves small, unusable gaps between allocated blocks. The Buddy System minimizes this by way of merging adjacent loose blocks into large ones whenever feasible.\n\n- **Allocation Efficiency:** The Buddy System presents quite speedy allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. Since memory blocks are pre-allotted and managed in a based manner, the overhead of finding and allocating reminiscence is decreased compared to extra complicated reminiscence control strategies.\n\n- **Power of Two Block Sizes:** The Buddy System commonly divides memory into blocks of sizes which can be powers of (e.g., 1KB, 2KB, 4KB, etc.). This simplifies the splitting and merging strategies, as blocks may be easily divided or blended.\n\n## **Advantages of Buddy System**\n\n- Buddy System is easy to implement.\n- It allocates block of correct size.\n- It is easy to merge adjacent holes.\n- Fast to allocate memory and de-allocating memory.\n- It provides optimal memory performance while allocating blocks of memory of appropriate size and prevents unnecessary memory waste, unlike other allocation techniques which allocate larger memory blocks than necessary.\n- It provides a flexible and efficient way to manage memory allocation in systems that require dynamic memory allocation, such as embedded systems and operating systems.\n- It can handle a large number of small memory allocations efficiently thanks to its block partitioning mechanism, which helps prevent fragmentation and keeps system performance up.\n- It can prevent memory leaks by ensuring that all shared memory is cleared when not in use, which can improve system stability and reliability.\n- It provides a high level of flexibility in memory allocation and monitoring processes, which is particularly useful in systems that require frequent memory allocation and sharing, such as [real-time systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/real-time-operating-system-rtos/).\n\n## **Disadvantages of Buddy System**\n\n- It requires all allocation unit to be powers of 2\n- It leads to [internal fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-fragmentation-in-os/)\n- It is designed for [fixed-sized memory allocations,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fixed-or-static-partitioning-in-operating-system/) and it is not suitable for variable-sized allocations. This can limit its applicability in some systems, such as databases and file systems.\n- It is a general-purpose memory allocation technique and may not be optimal for all applications. Some applications may require more specialized memory allocation techniques to achieve the best performance.\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n- [Buddy Memory Allocation Program \\| Set 1 (Allocation)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-memory-allocation-program-set-1-allocation/)\n\n- [Buddy Memory Allocation Program \\| Set 2 (Deallocation)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-memory-allocation-program-set-2-deallocation/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Question on Buddy System \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **How does the Buddy System work?**\n\n> In the Buddy System, memory is split into constant-size blocks. When a reminiscence allocation request is made, the system searches for the ideal-sized block. If an actual match is discovered, the block is allotted. Otherwise, a bigger block is cut up into smaller \u201cfriend\u201d blocks till an accurately sized one is acquired. When reminiscence is deallocated, the system merges adjacent loose blocks back into larger blocks to reduce fragmentation.\n\n### What are the advantages of the Buddy System?\n\n> Some advantages of the Buddy System encompass decreased fragmentation, efficient reminiscence allocation and deallocation, scalability with increasing reminiscence demands, and comparatively easy implementation as compared to more complicated reminiscence management techniques.\n\n### Where is the Buddy System used?\n\n> The Buddy System is normally used in running structures, mainly in environments wherein memory is allotted and deallocated frequently, including multitasking structures or structures with varying memory needs. It is frequently hired in reminiscence allocators, which includes the pal allocator in the Linux kernel.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Samit%20Mandal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Samit Mandal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Samit%20Mandal/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n58\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Deadlock, Starvation, and Livelock\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite - Deadlock and Starvation\u00c2\u00a0 Livelock occurs when two or more processes continually repeat the same interaction in response to changes in the other processes without doing any useful work.

The process of retrieving processes in the form of pages from the secondary storage into the main memory is known as paging. The basic purpose of paging is to separate each procedure into pages.\n\nThe mapping between logical pages and physical page frames is maintained by the page table, which is used by the memory management unit to translate logical addresses into physical addresses. The page table maps each logical page number to a physical page frame number. By using a Page Table, the operating system keeps track of the mapping between logical addresses (used by programs) and physical addresses (actual locations in memory).\n\n## Why Paging is used for memory Management?\n\nPaging is a memory management technique that addresses common challenges in allocating and managing memory efficiently. Here we can understand why paging is needed as a Memory Management technique:\n\n- **Memory isn\u2019t always available in a single block:** Programs often need more memory than what is available in a single continuous block. Paging breaks memory into smaller, fixed-size pieces, making it easier to allocate scattered free spaces.\n\n- **Processes size can increase or decrease:** programs don\u2019t need to occupy continuous memory, so they can grow dynamically without the need to be moved.\n\n## **Terminologies Associated with Memory Control**\n\n- **Logical Address or Virtual Address:** The [Logical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/), also known as the Virtual Address, is the address generated by the CPU when a program accesses memory.\n\n- **Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space:** The Logical Address Space, also known as the Virtual Address Space, refers to the set of all possible logical addresses that a process can generate during its execution. It is a conceptual range of memory addresses used by a program and is independent of the actual physical memory (RAM).\n\n- **Physical Address:** A [Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) is the actual location in the computer\u2019s physical memory (RAM) where data or instructions are stored. It is used by the memory hardware to access specific data in the system\u2019s memory.\n\n- **Physical Address Space:** The Physical Address Space refers to the total range of addresses available in a computer\u2019s physical memory (RAM). It represents the actual memory locations that can be accessed by the system hardware to store or retrieve data.\n\n## Important Features of Paging in PC Reminiscence Management\n\n- **Logical to bodily address mapping:** In paging, the logical address area of a technique is divided into constant-sized pages, and each web page is mapped to a corresponding physical body within the main reminiscence. This permits the working gadget to manipulate the memory in an extra flexible way, as it is able to allocate and deallocate frames as needed.\n\n- **Fixed web page and frame length:** Paging makes use of a set web page length, which is usually identical to the size of a frame within the most important memory. This facilitates simplifying the reminiscence control technique and improves device performance.\n\n- **Page desk entries:** Each page within the logical address area of a method is represented through a [page table entry (PTE)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-table-entries-in-page-table/), which contains facts approximately the corresponding bodily body in the predominant memory. This consists of the frame range, in addition to other manipulate bits which can be used by the running machine to manage the reminiscence.\n\n- **A number of page desk entries:** The range of page desk entries in a manner\u2019s page desk is identical to the wide variety of pages inside the logical deal with the area of the technique.\n\n- **Page table stored in important memory:** The web page desk for each system is typically saved in important reminiscence, to allow for green get right of entry to and change by the operating device. However, this could additionally introduce overhead, because the web page table must be updated on every occasion a system is swapped in or out of the main memory.\n\n## How Paging Works?\n\nPaging is a method used by operating systems to manage memory efficiently. In paging, the physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pageframes, which are the same size as the pages used by the process. The process\u2019s logical address space is also divided into fixed-size blocks called pages, which are the same size as the page frames.\n\nWhen a process requests memory, the operating system allocates one or more page frames to the process and maps the process\u2019s **logical pages** to the physical page frames. When a program runs, its pages are loaded into any available frames in the physical memory.\n\nThis approach prevents [fragmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-fragmentation-in-operating-system/) issues by keeping memory allocation uniform. Each program has a page table, which the operating system uses to keep track of where each page is stored in physical memory. When a program accesses data, the system uses this table to convert the program\u2019s address into a physical memory address.\n\nPaging allows for better memory use and makes it easier to manage. It also supports [virtual memory,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) letting parts of programs be stored on disk and loaded into memory only when needed. This way, even large programs can run without fitting entirely into main memory.\n\n- If Logical Address = 31 bit, then Logical Address Space = 231 words = 2 G words (1 G = 230)\n- If Logical Address Space = 128 M words = 27 \\\\* 220 words, then Logical Address = log2 227 = 27 bits\n- If Physical Address = 22 bit, then Physical Address Space = 222 words = 4 M words (1 M = 220)\n- If Physical Address Space = 16 M words = 24 \\\\* 220 words, then Physical Address = log2 224 = 24 bits\n\nThe mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/) which is a hardware device and this mapping is known as the paging technique.\n\n- The Physical Address Space is conceptually divided into a number of fixed-size blocks, called **frames**.\n- The Logical Address Space is also split into fixed-size blocks, called **pages**.\n- Page Size = Frame Size\n\n## Example\n\n- Physical Address = 12 bits, then Physical Address Space = 4 K words\n- Logical Address = 13 bits, then Logical Address Space = 8 K words\n- Page size = frame size = 1 K words (assumption)\n\n```\nNumber of frames = Physical Address Space / Frame Size = 4K / 1K = 4 = 22\nNumber of Pages = Logical Address Space / Page Size = 8K / 1K = 23\n```\n\n![paging](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250109113209275879/paging.webp)\n\nThe address generated by the CPU is divided into\n\n1. **Page number(p):** Number of bits required to represent the pages in [Logical Address Space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) or Page number\n2. **Page offset(d):** Number of bits required to represent a particular word in a page or page size of Logical Address Space or word number of a page or page offset.\n\nA **Physical Address** is divided into two main parts:\n\n1. **Frame Number(f):**\u00a0Number of bits required to represent the frame of Physical Address Space or Frame number frame\n2. **Frame Offset(d):**\u00a0Number of bits required to represent a particular word in a frame or frame size of Physical Address Space or word number of a frame or frame offset.\n\nSo, a physical address in this scheme may be represented as follows:\n\n```\nPhysical Address = (Frame Number << Number of Bits in Frame Offset) + Frame Offset\nwhere \"<<\" represents a bitwise left shift operation.\n```\n\n- The [TLB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/) is associative, high-speed memory.\n- Each entry in TLB consists of two parts: a tag and a value.\n- When this memory is used, then an item is compared with all tags simultaneously. If the item is found, then the corresponding value is returned.\n\nPaging is a memory management technique used in operating systems to manage memory and allocate memory to processes. In paging, memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages, and processes are allocated memory in terms of these pages. Each page is of the same size, and the size is typically a power of 2, such as 4KB or 8 KB.\n\n## Hardware implementation of Paging\n\nThe hardware implementation of the page table can be done by using dedicated registers. But the usage of the register for the page table is satisfactory only if the page table is small. If the page table contains a large number of entries then we can use TLB(translation Look-aside buffer), a special, small, fast look-up hardware cache.\n\n- The [TLB](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/) is associative, high-speed memory.\n- Each entry in TLB consists of two parts: a tag and a value.\n- When this memory is used, then an item is compared with all tags simultaneously. If the item is found, then the corresponding value is returned.\n\n![page_table](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250109124045975151/page_table.webp)\n\n```\nMain memory access time = m\nIf page table are kept in main memory,\nEffective access time = m(for page table) + m(for particular page in page table)\n```\n\nRead more about \u2013 [TLB hit and miss](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb-in-paging/)\n\n## Advantages of Paging\n\n- **Eliminates External Fragmentation:** Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks (pages and frames), so processes can be loaded wherever there is free space in memory. This prevents wasted space due to fragmentation.\n\n- **Efficient Memory Utilization:** Since pages can be placed in non-contiguous memory locations, even small free spaces can be utilized, leading to better memory allocation.\n\n- **Supports Virtual Memory:** Paging enables the implementation of virtual memory, allowing processes to use more memory than physically available by swapping pages between RAM and secondary storage.\n\n- **Ease of Swapping:** Individual pages can be moved between physical memory and disk (swap space) without affecting the entire process, making swapping faster and more efficient.\n\n- **Improved Security and Isolation:** Each process works within its own set of pages, preventing one process from accessing another\u2019s memory space.\n\n## Disadvantages of Paging\n\n- **Internal Fragmentation:** If the size of a process is not a perfect multiple of the page size, the unused space in the last page results in internal fragmentation.\n\n- **Increased Overhead:** Maintaining the PageTable requires additional memory and processing. For large processes, the page table can grow significantly, consuming valuable memory resources.\n\n- **Page Table Lookup Time:** Accessing memory requires translating logical addresses to physical addresses using the page table. This additional step increases memory access time, although Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) can help reduce the impact.\n\n- **I/O Overhead During Page Faults:** When a required page is not in physical memory (page fault), it needs to be fetched from secondary storage, causing delays and increased I/O operations.\n\n- **Complexity in Implementation:** Paging requires sophisticated hardware and software support, including the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and algorithms for [page replacement,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/) which add complexity to the system.\n\n## What is Memory Management Unit (MMU)?\n\nA memory management unit (MMU) is a technique used to convert logical address to physical address. Logical address is the address generated by CPU for each page and physical address is the real address of the frame where page is going to be stored.\n\nWhenever a page has to be accessed by CPU using the logical address, it requires physical address for accessing the page. Logical address comprises of two parts: Page Number and Offset.\n\nRead more about \u2013 [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-memory-management-unit/)\n\nAlso read \u2013 [Multilevel Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-paging-in-operating-system/)\n\nAlso read \u2013 [Paged Segmentation and Segmented Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paged-segmentation-and-segmented-paging/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, paging is a memory management technique that helps computers in storing data efficiently and it also helps in retrieve data as it breaks the memory into small, fixed size chunks called pages. It helps in handling larger amount of data without the issue of fragmentation that improves the performance and usability.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Paging \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the use of Paging in an Operating System?\n\n> Paging is a memory management technique that is used to retrieve processes from secondary storage to main memory.\n\n### What is the basic advantage of Paging?\n\n> Paging reduces internal fragmentation and in paging there is a possibility of external fragmentation.\n\n### What is the effect of Paging?\n\n> Paging helps in improving the performance of the system by improving the utilization of the memory and accessing the available memory present there.\n\n[iframe](https://cdnads.geeksforgeeks.org/instream/video.html)\n\nPaging in Operating System\n\n[Visit Course![explore course icon](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Vector11.svg)](https://gfgcdn.com/tu/U4D/)\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmentation-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Segmentation in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmentation-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n307\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [memory-management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/memory-management/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Operating System Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAn Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.

The chunks that a program is divided into which are not necessarily all of the exact sizes are called segments. Segmentation gives the user\u2019s view of the process which paging does not provide. Here the user\u2019s view is mapped to physical memory.\n\n## Types of Segmentation in Operating Systems\n\n- **Virtual Memory Segmentation:** Each process is divided into a number of segments, but the segmentation is not done all at once. This segmentation may or may not take place at the run time of the program.\n- **Simple Segmentation:** Each process is divided into a number of segments, all of which are loaded into memory at run time, though not necessarily contiguously.\n\nThere is no simple relationship between logical addresses and physical addresses in segmentation. A table stores the information about all such segments and is called Segment Table.\n\n## **What is Segment Table?**\n\nIt maps a two-dimensional Logical address into a one-dimensional Physical address. It\u2019s each table entry has:\n\n- **Base Address:** It contains the starting physical address where the segments reside in memory.\n- **Segment Limit:** Also known as segment offset. It specifies the length of the segment.\n\n![Segmentation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230703103700/ezgifcom-gif-maker-(16).webp)\n\nSegmentation\n\nTranslation of Two-dimensional Logical Address to\u00a0Dimensional Physical Address.\n\n![Translation](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230703104323/ezgifcom-gif-maker-(15).webp)\n\nTranslation\n\nThe address generated by the CPU\u00a0is divided into:\n\n- **Segment number (s):** Number of bits required to represent the segment.\n- **Segment offset (d):** Number of bits required to represent the position of data within a segment.\n\n## **Advantages of Segmentation in Operating System**\n\n- **Reduced Internal Fragmentation** : Segmentation can reduce internal fragmentation compared to fixed-size paging, as segments can be sized according to the actual needs of a process. However, internal fragmentation can still occur if a segment is allocated more space than it is actually used.\n- Segment Table consumes less space in comparison to Page table in paging.\n- As a complete module is loaded all at once, segmentation improves CPU utilization.\n- The user\u2019s perception of physical memory is quite similar to segmentation. Users can divide user programs into modules via segmentation. These modules are nothing more than separate processes\u2019 codes.\n- The user specifies the segment size, whereas, in paging, the hardware determines the page size.\n- Segmentation is a method that can be used to segregate data from security operations.\n- **Flexibility:** Segmentation provides a higher degree of flexibility than paging. Segments can be of variable size, and processes can be designed to have multiple segments, allowing for more fine-grained memory allocation.\n- **Sharing:** Segmentation allows for sharing of memory segments between processes. This can be useful for inter-process communication or for sharing code libraries.\n- **Protection:** Segmentation provides a level of protection between segments, preventing one process from accessing or modifying another process\u2019s memory segment. This can help increase the security and stability of the system.\n\n## **Disadvantages of Segmentation in Operating System**\n\n- **External Fragmentation** : As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces, causing external fragmentation. This is a notable difference from paging, where external fragmentation is significantly lesser.\n- Overhead is associated with keeping a segment table for each activity.\n- Due to the need for two memory accesses, one for the segment table and the other for main memory, access time to retrieve the instruction increases.\n- **Fragmentation:** As mentioned, segmentation can lead to external fragmentation as memory becomes divided into smaller segments. This can lead to wasted memory and decreased performance.\n- **Overhead:** Using a segment table can increase overhead and reduce performance. Each segment table entry requires additional memory, and accessing the table to retrieve memory locations can increase the time needed for memory operations.\n- **Complexity:** Segmentation can be more complex to implement and manage than paging. In particular, managing multiple segments per process can be challenging, and the potential for segmentation faults can increase as a result.\n\n## FAQs on Segmentation\n\n### 1\\. What is Segmentation?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Segmentation in Operating systems can be determined as a division of primary memory into small-sized blocks.\n\n### 2\\. Why is Segmentation used in OS?\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Segmentation is a memory management technique that is used to improve the performance of an Operating System.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n225\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [memory-management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/memory-management/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Operating System Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAn Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.

It allows larger applications to run on systems with less RAM.\n\n- The main objective of virtual memory is to support multiprogramming, The main advantage that virtual memory provides is, a running process does not need to be entirely in memory.\n- Programs can be larger than the available physical memory. Virtual Memory provides an abstraction of main memory, eliminating concerns about storage limitations.\n- A memory hierarchy, consisting of a computer system\u2019s memory and a disk, enables a process to operate with only some portions of its address space in RAM to allow more processes to be in memory.\n\n![virtual_memory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250115142221545470/virtual_memory.webp)\n\nA virtual memory is what its name indicates- it is an illusion of a memory that is larger than the real memory. We refer to the software component of virtual memory as a virtual memory manager. The basis of virtual memory is the noncontiguous memory allocation model. The virtual memory manager removes some components from memory to make room for other components.\n\nThe size of virtual storage is limited by the addressing scheme of the computer system and the amount of secondary memory available not by the actual number of main storage locations.\n\n## The History of Virtual Memory\n\nBefore virtual memory, computers used RAM and secondary memory for data storage. Early computers used magnetic core in place of main memory and magnetic drums in place of secondary memory. In the 1940s and 1950s, computer memory was very expensive and limited in size. As programs became larger and more complex, developers had to worry that their programs might use up all the available memory and cause the computer to run out of space to work.\n\nIn those early days, if program was larger than available space then programmers use the concept of overlaying. If some portion of the code that is not currently used move to overlying if needed it back overwritten to memory this cause extensive programming. This is the reason for developing virtual memory.\n\nIn 1956, German physicist **Fritz-Rudolf G\u00fcntsch** develop virtual memory. The first real example of a virtual memory system was created at the University of Manchester in England while developing the Atlas computer. This system used a method called paging, which allowed virtual addresses (used by programs) to be mapped to the computer\u2019s main memory. The Atlas computer was built in 1959 and started working in 1962.\n\nThe first computer with virtual memory was released by Burroughs Corp in 1961. This version of virtual memory do not using paging it oppose paging but support segmentation.\n\n## How Virtual Memory Works?\n\nVirtual Memory is a technique that is implemented using both hardware and software. It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.\n\n- All memory references within a process are logical addresses that are dynamically translated into [physical addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) at run time. This means that a process can be swapped in and out of the main memory such that it occupies different places in the main memory at different times during the course of execution.\n\n- A process may be broken into a number of pieces and these pieces need not be continuously located in the [main memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-memory/) during execution. The combination of dynamic run-time address translation and the use of a page or segment table permits this.\n\nIf these characteristics are present then, it is not necessary that all the pages or segments are present in the main memory during execution. This means that the required pages need to be loaded into memory whenever required. Virtual memory is implemented using Demand Paging or Demand Segmentation.\n\n## Types of Virtual Memory\n\nIn a computer, virtual memory is managed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU), which is often built into the CPU. The CPU generates virtual addresses that the [MMU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-memory-management-unit/) translates into physical addresses.\n\nThere are two main types of virtual memory:\n\n- Paging\n- Segmentation\n\n## **Paging**\n\nPaging divides memory into small fixed-size blocks called pages. When the computer runs out of RAM, pages that aren\u2019t currently in use are moved to the hard drive, into an area called a swap file. The swap file acts as an extension of RAM. When a page is needed again, it is swapped back into RAM, a process known as page swapping. This ensures that the operating system (OS) and applications have enough memory to run.\n\n**Demand Paging:** The process of loading the page into memory on demand (whenever a page fault occurs) is known as [demand paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-demand-paging-in-operating-system/). The process includes the following steps are as follows:\n\n![Demand Paging](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230908065723/page1-768.webp)\n\n- If the CPU tries to refer to a page that is currently not available in the main memory, it generates an interrupt indicating a memory access fault.\n- The OS puts the interrupted process in a blocking state. For the execution to proceed the OS must bring the required page into the memory.\n- The OS will search for the required page in the logical address space.\n- The required page will be brought from logical address space to physical address space. The page replacement algorithms are used for the decision-making of replacing the page in physical address space.\n- The page table will be updated accordingly.\n- The signal will be sent to the CPU to continue the program execution and it will place the process back into the ready state.\n\nHence whenever a page fault occurs these steps are followed by the operating system and the required page is brought into memory.\n\n### **What is Page Fault Service Time?**\n\nThe time taken to service the page fault is called page fault service time. The page fault service time includes the time taken to perform all the above six steps.\n\n```\nLet Main memory access time is: m\nPage fault service time is: s\nPage fault rate is : p\nThen, Effective memory access time = (p*s) + (1-p)*m\n```\n\n## Page vs Frame\n\nA page is a fixed size block of data in virtual memory and a frame is a fixed size block of physical memory in RAM where these pages are loaded. Think of a page as a piece of a puzzle (virtual memory) and a frame as the spot where it fits on the board (physical memory). When a program runs its pages are mapped to available frames so the program can run even if the program size is larger than physical memory.\n\n## Segmentation\n\nSegmentation divides virtual memory into segments of different sizes. Segments that aren\u2019t currently needed can be moved to the hard drive. The system uses a segment table to keep track of each segment\u2019s status, including whether it\u2019s in memory, if it\u2019s been modified, and its physical address. Segments are mapped into a process\u2019s address space only when needed.\n\nread more about \u2013 [Segmentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/segmentation-in-operating-system/)\n\n## Combining Paging and Segmentation\n\nSometimes, both paging and segmentation are used together. In this case, memory is divided into pages, and segments are made up of multiple pages. The virtual address includes both a segment number and a page number.\n\n## Virtual Memory vs Physical Memory\n\n| Feature | Virtual Memory | Physical Memory (RAM) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Definition** | An abstraction that extends the available memory by using disk storage | The actual hardware (RAM) that stores data and instructions currently being used by the CPU |\n| **Location** | On the hard drive or SSD | On the computer\u2019s motherboard |\n| **Speed** | Slower (due to disk I/O operations) | Faster (accessed directly by the CPU) |\n| **Capacity** | Larger, limited by disk space | Smaller, limited by the amount of RAM installed |\n| **Cost** | Lower (cost of additional disk storage) | Higher (cost of RAM modules) |\n| **Data Access** | Indirect (via paging and swapping) | Direct (CPU can access data directly) |\n| **Volatility** | Non-volatile (data persists on disk) | Volatile (data is lost when power is off) |\n\n## **What is Swapping?**\n\nSwapping is a process out means removing all of its pages from memory, or marking them so that they will be removed by the normal page replacement process. Suspending a process ensures that it is not runnable while it is swapped out. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to the main memory. When a process is busy [swapping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swapping-in-operating-system/) pages in and out then this situation is called thrashing.\n\n![Swapping](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230711080232/VirtualDiagram-2.webp)\n\nSwappinghierar\n\n## **What is Thrashing?**\n\nAt any given time, only a few pages of any process are in the main memory, and therefore more processes can be maintained in memory. Furthermore, time is saved because unused pages are not swapped in and out of memory. However, the OS must be clever about how it manages this scheme. In the steady state practically, all of the main memory will be occupied with process pages, so that the processor and OS have direct access to as many processes as possible. Thus when the OS brings one page in, it must throw another out. If it throws out a page just before it is used, then it will just have to get that page again almost immediately. Too much of this leads to a condition called [Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/distributed-system-thrashing-in-distributed-shared-memory/). The system spends most of its time swapping pages rather than executing instructions. So a good page replacement algorithm is required.\n\n![Degree-of-multiprogramming](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023104029003958/Degree-of-multiprogramming.png)\n\nIn the given diagram, the initial degree of multiprogramming up to some extent of point(lambda), the CPU utilization is very high and the system resources are utilized 100%. But if we further increase the degree of multiprogramming the CPU utilization will drastically fall down and the system will spend more time only on the page replacement and the time taken to complete the execution of the process will increase. This situation in the system is called thrashing.\n\n## **Causes of Thrashing**\n\nThrashing occurs in a computer system when the CPU spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory than executing actual processes. This happens when there is insufficient physical memory, causing frequent page faults and excessive paging activity. Thrashing reduces system performance and makes processes run very slowly. There are many cause of thrashing as discussed below.\n\n### **1\\. High Degree of Multiprogramming**\n\nIf the number of processes keeps on increasing in the memory then the number of frames allocated to each process will be decreased. So, fewer frames will be available for each process. Due to this, a [page fault](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/) will occur more frequently and more CPU time will be wasted in just swapping in and out of pages and the utilization will keep on decreasing.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet free frames = 400\n\n**Case 1**: Number of processes = 100\n\nThen, each process will get 4 frames.\n\n**Case 2**: Number of processes = 400\n\nEach process will get 1 frame.\n\nCase 2 is a condition of thrashing, as the number of processes is increased, frames per process are decreased. Hence CPU time will be consumed just by swapping pages.\n\n### **2\\. Lacks of Frames**\n\nIf a process has fewer frames then fewer pages of that process will be able to reside in memory and hence more frequent swapping in and out will be required. This may lead to thrashing. Hence a sufficient amount of frames must be allocated to each process in order to prevent thrashing.\n\n## **Recovery of Thrashing**\n\n- Do not allow the system to go into thrashing by instructing the long-term scheduler not to bring the processes into memory after the threshold.\n- If the system is already thrashing then instruct the [mid-term scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/medium-term-scheduler-in-operating-system/) to suspend some of the processes so that we can recover the system from thrashing.\n\n## **Performance in Virtual Memory**\n\n- Let p be the page fault rate( 0 <= p <= 1).\n- if p = 0 no page faults\n- if p =1, every reference is a fault.\n\n```\nEffective access time (EAT) = (1-p)* Memory Access Time + p * Page fault time.\nPage fault time = page fault overhead + swap out + swap in +restart overhead\n\n```\n\nThe performance of a virtual memory management system depends on the total number of page faults, which depend on \u201c [paging policies](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)\u201d and \u201c [frame allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)\u201c\n\nread more about \u2013 [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)\n\n## **Frame Allocation**\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 A number of frames allocated to each process in either static or dynamic.\n\n- **Static Allocation:** The number of frame allocations to a process is fixed.\n- **Dynamic Allocation:** The number of frames allocated to a process changes.\n\n## **Paging Policies**\n\n- **Fetch Policy:** It decides when a page should be loaded into memory.\n- **Replacement Policy:** It decides which page in memory should be replaced.\n- **Placement Policy:** It decides where in memory should a page be loaded.\n\n## What are the Applications of Virtual memory?\n\nVirtual memory has the following important characteristics that increase the capabilities of the computer system. The following are five significant characteristics of Lean.\n\n- **Increased Effective Memory:** One major practical application of virtual memory is, virtual memory enables a computer to have more memory than the physical memory using the disk space. This allows for the running of larger applications and numerous programs at one time while not necessarily needing an equivalent amount of [DRAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dram-full-form/).\n\n- **Memory Isolation:** Virtual memory allocates a unique address space to each process and that also plays a role in process segmentation. Such separation increases safety and reliability based on the fact that one process cannot interact with and or modify another\u2019s memory space through a mistake, or even a deliberate act of vandalism.\n\n- **Efficient Memory Management:** Virtual memory also helps in better utilization of the physical memories through methods that include paging and segmentation. It can transfer some of the memory pages that are not frequently used to disk allowing RAM to be used by active processes when required in a way that assists in efficient use of memory as well as system performance.\n\n- **Simplified Program Development:** For case of programmers, they don\u2019t have to consider physical memory available in a system in case of having virtual memory. They can program \u2018as if\u2019 there is one big block of memory and this makes the programming easier and more efficient in delivering more complex applications.\n\n## How to Manage Virtual Memory?\n\nHere are 5 key points on how to manage virtual memory:\n\n### 1\\. Adjust the Page File Size\n\n- **Automatic Management**: All contemporary operating systems including Windows contain the auto-configuration option for the size of the empirical page file. But depending on the size of the RAM, they are set automatically, although the user can manually adjust the page file size if required.\n\n- **Manual Configuration:** For tuned up users, the setting of the custom size can sometimes boost up the performance of the system. The initial size is usually advised to be set to the minimum value of 1. To set the size of the swap space equal to 5 times the amount of physical RAM and the maximum size 3 times the physical RAM.\n\n### 2\\. Place the Page File on a Fast Drive\n\n- **SSD Placement:** If this is feasible, the page file should be stored in the SSD instead of the [HDD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hard-disk-drive-hdd-secondary-memory/) as a storage device. It has better read and write times, and the virtual memory may prove beneficial in an SSD.\n\n- **Separate Drive:** Regarding systems having multiple drives involved, the page file needs to be placed on a different drive than the OS and that shall in turn improve its performance.\n\n### 3\\. Monitor and Optimize Usage\n\n- **Performance Monitoring:** Employ the software tools used in monitoring the performance of the system in tracking the amounts of virtual memory. High page file usage may signify that there is a lack of physical RAM or that virtual memory needs a change of settings or addition in physical RAM.\n\n- **Regular Maintenance:** Make sure there is no toolbar or other application running in the background, take time and uninstall all the tool bars to free virtual memory.\n\n### 4\\. Disable Virtual Memory for SSD\n\n- **Sufficient RAM:** If for instance your system has a big physical memory, for example 16GB and above then it would be advised to freeze the page file in order to minimize [SSD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-solid-state-drive-ssd/) usage. But it should be done, in my opinion, carefully and only if the additional signals that one decides to feed into his applications should not likely use all the available RAM.\n\n### 5\\. Optimize System Settings\n\n- **System Configuration:** Change some general properties of the system concerning virtual memory efficiency. This also involves enabling additional control options in Windows such as adjusting additional system setting option on the operating system, or using other options in different operating systems such as [Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-linux-operating-system/) that provides different tools and commands to help in adjusting how virtual memory is utilized.\n\n- **Regular Updates:** Ensure that your drivers are run in their newest version because new releases contain some enhancements and issues regarding memory management.\n\n## **What are the Benefits**\u00a0of Using Virtual Memory?\n\n- Many processes maintained in the main memory.\n- A process larger than the main memory can be executed because of demand [paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/). The OS itself loads pages of a process in the main memory as required.\n- It allows greater multiprogramming levels by using less of the available (primary) memory for each process.\n- It has twice the capacity for addresses as main memory.\n- It makes it possible to run more applications at once.\n- Users are spared from having to add memory modules when RAM space runs out, and applications are liberated from shared memory management.\n- When only a portion of a program is required for execution, speed has increased.\n- Memory isolation has increased security.\n- It makes it possible for several larger applications to run at once.\n- Memory allocation is comparatively cheap.\n- It doesn\u2019t require outside fragmentation.\n- It is efficient to manage logical partition workloads using the [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-cpu-and-gpu/).\n- Automatic data movement is possible.\n\n## **What are the Limitation of Virtual Memory?**\n\n- It can slow down the system performance, as data needs to be constantly transferred between the physical memory and the hard disk.\n- It can increase the risk of data loss or corruption, as data can be lost if the hard disk fails or if there is a power outage while data is being transferred to or from the hard disk.\n- It can increase the complexity of the memory management system, as the operating system needs to manage both physical and virtual memory.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, virtual memory is a crucial feature in [operating systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) that allows computers to run larger applications and handle more processes than the physical RAM alone can support. By using techniques like paging and segmentation, the system extends the available memory onto the [hard drive](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-memory-and-hard-disk/), ensuring that the operating system and applications can operate smoothly. Although virtual memory can introduce some performance overhead due to the slower speed of hard drives compared to [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/), it provides significant benefits in terms of memory management, efficiency, and multitasking capabilities.\n\nread more about \u2013 [Virtual Memory Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-questions/)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Memory \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **Why is virtual memory important?**\n\n> Virtual memory is important because it allows the system to handle larger applications and multiple applications simultaneously without running out of physical memory. It helps in optimizing the use of available RAM and provides a buffer against memory shortages.\n\n### What is a page file or swap space in virtual memory?\n\n> Page file is also known as Virtual memory file in windows while Swap space is known as page file in Unix/Linux It is a disk area assigned by the operating system to act as extension of physical memory. If RAM is saturated, then finally inactive page of memory is swapped to this area, to provide the occupied RAM for more active processes. This process is known as paging or swapping.\n\n### Can virtual memory affect system performance?\n\n> Virtual memory may affect the efficiency of the operation of the computer. Too much usage of the virtual memory will result in what is referred to as a thrashing where the system spends most of its time swapping data between the RAM and the disk with less time executing applications thus, slows down the system. This can be solved by having enough physical RAM and to correctly setup the page file or swap space.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/?ref=next_article)\n\n[![author](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/profile/sb7ciorr5k5t22woqkes)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[kartik](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/kartik/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n276\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [memory-management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/memory-management/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Operating System Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nAn Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device.

It is a widely implemented Practice in the Computational field.\n\n**Memory Interleaving** is less or More an Abstraction technique. Though it\u2019s a bit different from Abstraction. It is a Technique that divides memory into a number of modules such that Successive words in the address space are placed in the Different modules.\n\n**Consecutive Word in a Module:**\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/raw-1.png)\n\n**Figure-1:** Consecutive Word in a Module\n\nLet us assume 16 Data\u2019s to be Transferred to the Four Module. Where Module 00 be Module 1, Module 01 be Module 2, Module 10 be Module 3 & Module 11 be Module 4. Also, 10, 20, 30\u2026.130 are the data to be transferred.\n\nFrom the figure above in Module 1, 10 \\[Data\\] is transferred then 20, 30 & finally, 40 which are the Data. That means the data are added consecutively in the Module till its max capacity.\n\nMost significant bit (MSB) provides the Address of the Module & the least significant bit (LSB) provides the address of the data in the module.\n\nFor **Example**, to get 90 (Data) 1000 will be provided by the processor. This 10 will indicate that the data is in module 10 (module 3) & 00 is the address of 90 in Module 10 (module 3). So,\n\n```\nModule 1 Contains Data : 10, 20, 30, 40\nModule 2 Contains Data : 50, 60, 70, 80\nModule 3 Contains Data : 90, 100, 110, 120\nModule 4 Contains Data : 130, 140, 150, 160\n```\n\n**Consecutive Word in Consecutive Module:**\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/raw-2.png)\n\n**Figure-2:** Consecutive Word in Consecutive Module\n\nNow again we assume 16 Data\u2019s to be transferred to the Four Module. But Now the consecutive Data are added in Consecutive Module. That is, 10 \\[Data\\] is added in Module 1, 20 \\[Data\\] in Module 2 and So on.\n\nLeast Significant Bit (LSB) provides the Address of the Module & Most significant bit (MSB) provides the address of the data in the module.\n\nFor **Example**, to get 90 (Data) 1000 will be provided by the processor. This 00 will indicate that the data is in module 00 (module 1) & 10 is the address of 90 in Module 00 (module 1). That is,\n\n```\nModule 1 Contains Data : 10, 50, 90, 130\nModule 2 Contains Data : 20, 60, 100, 140\nModule 3 Contains Data : 30, 70, 110, 150\nModule 4 Contains Data : 40, 80, 120, 160\n```\n\n**Why do we use Memory Interleaving? \\[Advantages\\]:**\n\nWhenever Processor requests Data from the main memory. A block (chunk) of Data is Transferred to the cache and then to Processor. So whenever a cache miss occurs the Data is to be fetched from the main memory. But main memory is relatively slower than the cache. So to improve the access time of the main memory interleaving is used.\n\nWe can access all four Modules at the same time thus achieving Parallelism. From Figure 2 the data can be acquired from the Module using the Higher bits. This method Uses memory effectively.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-memory-and-memory-units/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Introduction to memory and memory units](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-memory-and-memory-units/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AnzarAlim/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[AnzarAlim](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/AnzarAlim/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n43\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Subject](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n## Machine instructions and addressing modes\n\n- [Computer Organization is like understanding the \"blueprint\" of how a computer works internally.

The installation of virtualization software also refers to Operating system-based virtualization. It is installed over a pre-existing operating system and that operating system is called the host operating system.\n\nIn this virtualization, a user installs the virtualization software in the operating system of his system like any other program and utilizes this application to operate and generate various virtual machines. Here, the virtualization software allows direct access to any of the created virtual machines to the user. As the host OS can provide hardware devices with the mandatory support, operating system virtualization may affect compatibility issues of hardware even when the hardware driver is not allocated to the virtualization software.\n\nVirtualization software is able to convert hardware IT resources that require unique software for operation into virtualized IT resources. As the host OS is a complete operating system in itself, many OS-based services are available as organizational management and administration tools can be utilized for the virtualization host management.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/33-11.png)\n\nSome major operating system-based services are mentioned below:\n\n1. Backup and Recovery.\n2. Security Management.\n3. Integration to Directory Services.\n\nVarious major operations of Operating System Based Virtualization are described below:\n\n1. Hardware capabilities can be employed, such as the network connection and CPU.\n2. Connected peripherals with which it can interact, such as a webcam, printer, keyboard, or Scanners.\n3. Data that can be read or written, such as files, folders, and network shares.\n\nThe Operating system may have the capability to allow or deny access to such resources based on which the program requests them and the user account in the context of which it runs. OS may also hide these resources, which leads that when a computer program computes them, they do not appear in the enumeration results. Nevertheless, from a programming perspective, the computer program has interacted with those resources and the operating system has managed an act of interaction.\n\nWith operating-system-virtualization or containerization, it is probable to run programs within containers, to which only parts of these resources are allocated. A program that is expected to perceive the whole computer, once run inside a container, can only see the allocated resources and believes them to be all that is available. Several containers can be formed on each operating system, to each of which a subset of the computer\u2019s resources is allocated. Each container may include many computer programs. These programs may run parallel or distinctly, even interrelate with each other.\n\n### features of operating system-based virtualization are:\n\n- **Resource isolation:** Operating system-based virtualization provides a high level of resource isolation, which allows each container to have its own set of resources, including CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth.\n- **Lightweight:** Containers are lightweight compared to traditional virtual machines as they share the same host operating system, resulting in faster startup and lower resource usage.\n- **Portability:** Containers are highly portable, making it easy to move them from one environment to another without needing to modify the underlying application.\n- **Scalability:** Containers can be easily scaled up or down based on the application requirements, allowing applications to be highly responsive to changes in demand.\n- **Security:** Containers provide a high level of security by isolating the containerized application from the host operating system and other containers running on the same system.\n- **Reduced Overhead:** Containers incur less overhead than traditional virtual machines, as they do not need to emulate a full hardware environment.\n- **Easy Management:** Containers are easy to manage, as they can be started, stopped, and monitored using simple commands.\n\nOperating system-based virtualization can raise demands and problems related to performance overhead, such as:\n\n1. The host operating system employs CPU, memory, and other hardware IT resources.\n2. Hardware-related calls from guest operating systems need to navigate numerous layers to and from the hardware, which shrinkage overall performance.\n3. Licenses are frequently essential for host operating systems, in addition to individual licenses for each of their guest operating systems.\n\n#### Advantages of Operating System-Based Virtualization:\n\n- **Resource Efficiency:** Operating system-based virtualization allows for greater resource efficiency as containers do not need to emulate a complete hardware environment, which reduces resource overhead.\n- **High Scalability:** Containers can be quickly and easily scaled up or down depending on the demand, which makes it easy to respond to changes in the workload. **Easy Management:** Containers are easy to manage as they can be managed through simple commands, which makes it easy to deploy and maintain large numbers of containers.\n\n**Reduced Costs:** Operating system-based virtualization can significantly reduce costs, as it requires fewer resources and infrastructure than traditional virtual machines.\n- **Faster Deployment:** Containers can be deployed quickly, reducing the time required to launch new applications or update existing ones.\n- **Portability:** Containers are highly portable, making it easy to move them from one environment to another without requiring changes to the underlying application.\n\n#### Disadvantages of Operating System-Based Virtualization:\n\n- **Security:** Operating system-based virtualization may pose security risks as containers share the same host operating system, which means that a security breach in one container could potentially affect all other containers running on the same system.\n- **Limited Isolation:** Containers may not provide complete isolation between applications, which can lead to performance degradation or resource contention.\n- **Complexity:** Operating system-based virtualization can be complex to set up and manage, requiring specialized skills and knowledge.\n- **Dependency Issues:** Containers may have dependency issues with other containers or the host operating system, which can lead to compatibility issues and hinder deployment.\n- **Limited Hardware Access:** Containers may have limited access to hardware resources, which can limit their ability to perform certain tasks or applications that require direct hardware access.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aws-tutorial/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Amazon Web Services (AWS) Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aws-tutorial/?ref=next_article)\n\n[M](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Madhurkant%20Sharma/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Madhurkant Sharma](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Madhurkant%20Sharma/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n14\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-networks/?ref=article_category)\n- [virtualization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/virtualization/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Cloud Computing Tutorial\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nCloud computing is a technology that enables us to create, configure, and customize applications through an internet connection.

Swap space is a space on a hard disk that is a substitute for physical memory. It is used as virtual memory which contains process memory images. Whenever our computer runs short of physical memory it uses its virtual memory and stores information in memory on disk. Swap space helps the computer\u2019s operating system in pretending that it has more RAM than it actually has. It is also called a swap file. This interchange of data between virtual memory and real memory is called swapping and space on disk as \u201cswap space\u201d.\n\nSwap space, also known as virtual memory or paging space, is a feature of an operating system that allows it to temporarily move inactive or less frequently used pages of memory from RAM to a designated area on the hard disk. The purpose of swap space is to free up physical memory (RAM) so that it can be used for more important tasks, while still allowing the system to maintain the illusion of having more memory than it actually has.\n\nWhen a system runs out of physical memory, it will start moving pages of memory to the swap space, which is typically a dedicated partition on the hard disk. The pages that are moved to swap space are those that have not been accessed in a while, or are not essential to the current operation of the system.\n\nWhile swap space can help to avoid system crashes due to lack of memory, it can also have a negative impact on system performance. When pages are swapped to and from disk, it can cause disk I/O operations that slow down the system. Additionally, if the system uses too much swap space, it can lead to thrashing, which is a condition where the system spends most of its time moving pages to and from disk instead of performing useful work.\n\nOverall, swap space is an important feature of modern operating systems that allows them to efficiently use physical memory. However, it is important to manage swap space carefully to avoid performance issues and ensure that the system has enough physical memory to meet its needs.\n\nVirtual memory is a combination of RAM and disk space that running processes can use. **Swap space** is the **portion of virtual memory** that is on the hard disk, used when RAM is full.\n\nSwap space can be useful to computers in various ways:\n\n- It can be used as a single contiguous memory which reduces I/O operations to read or write a file.\n- Applications that are not used or are used less can be kept in a swap file.\n- Having sufficient swap files helps the system keep some physical memory free all the time.\n- The space in physical memory which has been freed due to swap space can be used by OS for some other important tasks.\n\nOperating systems such as Windows, Linux, etc systems provide a certain amount of swap space by default which can be changed by users according to their needs. If you don\u2019t want to use virtual memory you can easily disable it all together but in case if you run out of memory then the kernel will kill some of the processes in order to create a sufficient amount of space in physical memory. So it totally depends upon the user whether he wants to use swap space or not.\n\n1. Swap space is a portion of a computer\u2019s hard disk that is reserved for use by the operating system as virtual memory. Virtual memory is an abstraction of RAM memory and allows the operating system to temporarily transfer pages of memory to disk when the RAM is full, freeing up the RAM for other uses. The operating system will transfer back to RAM those pages that are frequently accessed.\n2. Swap space is used as an overflow area for physical memory, so when the system runs out of RAM, inactive pages are moved from RAM to the swap space. This allows the operating system to continue running, although more slowly.\n3. Having swap space on a computer can help prevent the system from running out of memory and crashing. However, it\u2019s important to note that accessing the swap space is much slower than accessing RAM, so a computer with a lot of swap space usage will typically run much slower than a computer with adequate RAM.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s recommended to have a swap space equal to 1.5 times the size of the RAM. However, the exact size of the swap space needed will depend on the specific needs of the system and the applications running on it.\n\n### Advantages of Swap Space:\n\n1. Virtual memory: Swap space provides a way to extend the available physical memory by using disk space as an overflow area for inactive pages in memory.\n2. Increased system stability: By providing more memory, swap space can help prevent the system from running out of memory and crashing.\n3. Improved system performance: By temporarily transferring pages of memory to disk, swap space allows the system to free up RAM for other uses.\n4. Allows operating system to efficiently use physical memory by temporarily moving inactive or less frequently used pages of memory to the hard disk.\n5. Helps to prevent system crashes due to lack of physical memory.\n6. Provides a way to run more memory-intensive applications than would otherwise be possible with only physical memory.\n7. Allows for more efficient multitasking by freeing up physical memory for more important tasks.\n\n\n### Disadvantages of Swap Space:\n\n1. Performance degradation: Accessing the swap space is much slower than accessing RAM, so a computer with a lot of swap space usage will typically run much slower than a computer with adequate RAM.\n2. Disk space usage: Swap space requires a portion of the hard disk, so using too much swap space can limit the amount of disk space available for other uses.\n3. Can lead to performance issues if too much swap space is used or if pages are swapped to and from disk too frequently.\n4. May cause disk I/O operations that slow down the system.\n5. Can cause thrashing, a condition where the system spends most of its time moving pages to and from disk instead of performing useful work.\n6. May increase the risk of data loss if there is a power failure or system crash, since data in the swap space may not be saved to disk.\n\n### Reference books:\n\n1.

This triggers a sequence of events where the operating system must manage the fault by loading the required data from secondary storage into RAM. Page faults are essential for implementing virtual memory systems that provide the illusion of a larger contiguous memory space.\n\n## What is Page Fault?\n\nA page fault is a critical event in computer systems in which a program tries to attempt to access data or code that is not currently available in the physical memory (main memory). This occurrence is an integral part of [virtual memory management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) which allows the system to physically fit large amounts of data efficiently in memory. So when a page fault occurs then the following sequence of events happens:\n\n![page-fault](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/121-1.png)\n\n## Page Fault Handling Process\n\n- **Trap to Kernel:** The computer hardware traps to the kernel and program counter (PC) is saved on the stack. Current instruction state information is saved in [CPU registers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-classes-of-cpu-registers/). The hardwaredetectsthe page fault when the CPU attempts to access a virtual page that is not currently in physical memory (RAM).\n\n- **Save State Information:** An assembly program is started to save the general registers and other volatile information to keep the OS from destroying it.\n\n- **Determine Cause of Fault:** Operating system finds that a page fault has occurred and tries to find out which virtual page is needed. Sometimes hardware register contains this required information. If not, the operating system must retrieve PC, fetch instruction and find out what it was doing when the fault occurred.\n\n- **Validate Address:** Once [virtual address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-address-space-in-operating-system/) caused page fault is known, system checks to see if address is valid and checks if there is no protection access problem.\n\n- **Allocate Page Frame:** If the virtual address is valid, the system checks to see if a page frame is free. If no frames are free, the [page replacement algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/) is run to remove a page.\n\n- **Handle Dirty Pages:** If frame selected is dirty, page is scheduled for transfer to disk, context switch takes place, fault process is suspended and another process is made to run until disk transfer is completed.\n\n- **Load Page into Memory:** As soon as page frame is clean, operating system looks up disk address where needed page is, schedules disk operation to bring it in.\n\n- **Update Page Table:** When disk interrupt indicates page has arrived, page tables are updated to reflect its position, and frame marked as being in normal state.\n\n- **Restore State and Continue Execution:** Faulting instruction is backed up to state it had when it began, and PC is reset. Faulting is scheduled, operating system returns to routine that called it. Assembly Routine reloads register and other state information, returns to user space to continue execution.\n\n## Causes of Page Faults\n\nThere are several reasons of causing Page faults:\n\n- **Demand Paging:** Accessing the page that is not currently loaded in the memory (RAM).\n\n- **Invalid Memory Access,** it occurs when a program tries to access that memory which is it\u2019s beyond access boundaries or not allocated.\n\n- **Process Violation:** when a process tries to write to a read-only page or otherwise violates memory protection rules.\n\n## Types of Page Fault\n\n- **Minor Page Fault:** Occurs when the required page is in memory but not in current process\u2019s page table.\n\n- **Major Page Fault:** Occurs when the page is not in memory and must be fetched from disk.\n\n- **Invalid Page Fault:** It happens when the process tries to access an invalid memory address.\n\n## Impact of Page Faults or System Performance\n\nPage Fault impact the system if it occurs frequently\n\n- **Thrashing:** If occurrence of page fault is frequent then the system spends more time to handle it than executing the processes, and because of which overall performance also degrades.\n\n- **Increased Latency:** Fetching pages from disk takes more time than accessing them in memory, which causes to more delays.\n\n- **CPU Utilization:** If the Page fault occur excessively than it can reduce [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-cpu-and-gpu/) Utilization as the processor waits for for memory operations to complete or remain idle which is not efficient.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn an [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/), page fault handling is an essential process that ensures smooth and efficient memory management. When a program tries to access data that isn\u2019t currently in the computer\u2019s physical memory ( [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-ram-random-access-memory/)), a page fault occurs. The operating system steps in to retrieve the necessary data from a slower storage (like a hard drive) and loads it into RAM. Although page faults can temporarily slow down a program, they are a normal part of how virtual memory works, allowing computers to run large applications efficiently without needing an excessive amount of physical memory. Effective page fault handling helps the system maintain performance and stability.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on Page Fault Handling \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What is the difference between a minor and a major page fault?**\n\n> A minor page fault occurs when the page is already in memory but not in the current process\u2019s page table, while a major page fault requires to fetch the page from the disk because it is not in memory.\n\n### **How can the page fault be minimized?**\n\n> By optimizing memory usage, which helps to maintain the sufficient physical memory available, and using efficient algorithms for page replacement.\n\n### **Can Page faults be completely eliminated?**\n\n> No, it can\u2019t be possible, but their frequency can be reduced through efficient memory management and optimization techniques.\n\n### **What is thrashing, and how it is related to page faults?**\n\n> When a system spends more time in handling of page faults than executing processes, often due to insufficient memory. Which causes severe performance degradation of system.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-handling-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Error Handling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/error-handling-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n61\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [memory-management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/memory-management/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Page Fault Handling in Operating System\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA page fault occurs when a program attempts to access data or code that is in its address space but is not currently located in the system RAM.

It is basically used to enhance the speed of execution of the computer system, so that the processor is able to fetch and execute the data from the memory easily and fast.\n\n**Need for Segmentation \u2013**\n\nThe Bus Interface Unit (BIU) contains four 16 bit special purpose registers (mentioned below) called as Segment Registers.\n\n- **Code segment register (CS):** is used for addressing memory location in the code segment of the memory, where the executable program is stored.\n\n- **Data segment register (DS):** points to the data segment of the memory where the data is stored.\n- **Extra Segment Register (ES):** also refers to a segment in the memory which is another data segment in the memory.\n- **Stack Segment Register (SS):** is used for addressing stack segment of the memory. The stack segment is that segment of memory which is used to store stack data.\n\nThe number of address lines in 8086 is 20, 8086 BIU will send 20bit address, so as to access one of the 1MB memory locations. The four segment registers actually contain the upper 16 bits of the starting addresses of the four memory segments of 64 KB each with which the 8086 is working at that instant of time. A segment is a logical unit of memory that may be up to 64 kilobytes long. Each segment is made up of contiguous memory locations. It is an independent, separately addressable unit. Starting address will always be changing. It will not be fixed.\n\nNote that the 8086 does not work the whole 1MB memory at any given time. However, it works only with four 64KB segments within the whole 1MB memory.\n\nBelow is the one way of positioning four 64 kilobyte segments within the 1M byte memory space of an 8086.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-from-2018-05-10-09-52-11.png)\n\n**Types Of Segmentation \u2013**\n\n1. **Overlapping Segment \u2013** A segment starts at a particular address and its maximum size can go up to 64kilobytes. But if another segment starts along with this 64kilobytes location of the first segment, then the two are said to be _Overlapping Segment_.\n\n2. **Non-Overlapped Segment \u2013** A segment starts at a particular address and its maximum size can go up to 64kilobytes. But if another segment starts before this 64kilobytes location of the first segment, then the two segments are said to be _Non-Overlapped Segment_.\n\n\n**Rules of Segmentation** Segmentation process follows some rules as follows:\n\n- The starting address of a segment should be such that it can be evenly divided by 16.\n\n- Minimum size of a segment can be 16 bytes and the maximum can be 64 kB.\n\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190528231429/Screenshot-10521-300x86.png)\n\n**Advantages of the Segmentation** The main advantages of segmentation are as follows:\n\n  - It provides a powerful memory management mechanism.\n\n  - Data related or stack related operations can be performed in different segments.\n\n  - Code related operation can be done in separate code segments.\n\n  - It allows to processes to easily share data.\n\n  - It allows to extend the address ability of the processor, i.e. segmentation allows the use of 16 bit registers to give an addressing capability of 1 Megabytes. Without segmentation, it would require 20 bit registers.\n\n  - It is possible to enhance the memory size of code data or stack segments beyond 64 KB by allotting more than one segment for each area.\n\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/80386-microprocessor-state-after-reset/?ref=next_article)\n\n[80386 Microprocessor State After Reset](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/80386-microprocessor-state-after-reset/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Astha_Singh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[Astha\\_Singh](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/Astha_Singh/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n79\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Computer Organization & Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/computer-organization-architecture/?ref=article_category)\n- [microprocessor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/microprocessor/?ref=article_tag)\n- [system-programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/system-programming/?ref=article_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Memory Segmentation in 8086 Microprocessor\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite - Segmentation Segmentation is the process in which the main memory of the computer is logically divided into different segments and each segment has its own base address.

It begins as the first fit to find a free partition but when called next time it starts searching from where it left off, not from the beginning. This policy makes use of a roving pointer. The pointer moves along the memory chain to search for the next fit. This helps in, to avoid the usage of memory always from the head (beginning) of the free blockchain.\n\n## **What is its advantage over first fit?**\n\n- First fit is a straight and fast algorithm, but tends to cut a large portion of free parts into small pieces due to which, processes that need a large portion of memory block would not get anything even if the sum of all small pieces is greater than it required which is so-called external fragmentation problem.\n- Another problem of the first fit is that it tends to allocate memory parts at the beginning of the memory, which may lead to more internal fragments at the beginning. Next fit tries to address this problem by starting the search for the free portion of parts not from the start of the memory, but from where it ends last time.\n- Next fit is a very fast searching algorithm and is also comparatively faster than First Fit and Best Fit Memory Management Algorithms.\n\n```\nExample:\nInput :  blockSize[] = {5, 10, 20};\n     processSize[] = {10, 20, 30};\nOutput:\nProcess No.     Process Size    Block no.\n 1              10              2\n 2              20              3\n 3              30              Not Allocated\n```\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Input the number of memory blocks and their sizes and initializes all the blocks as free.\n2. Input the number of processes and their sizes.\n3. Start by picking each process and check if it can be assigned to the current block, if yes, allocate the required memory and check for next process but from the block where we left not from starting.\n4. If the current block size is smaller then keep checking the further blocks.\n\n![Next-Fit](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/next-fit-algorithm-operating-system.png)\n\nBelow is the implementation of the above approach:\n\n## C++\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n## Java\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `// Java program for next fit`<br>`// memory management algorithm`<br>`import`

memory fragmentation by leaving larger gaps between allocated partitions, which can be used for future allocations. This reduces the number of small gaps and helps in allocating larger contiguous blocks of memory to processes.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-best-fit-algorithm-memory-management/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Program for Best Fit algorithm in Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-best-fit-algorithm-memory-management/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n14\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [DSA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/?ref=article_category)\n- [Greedy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/dsa/algorithm/greedy/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\nPractice Tags :\n\n- [Greedy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explore?category=Greedy&ref=article_practice_tag)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Program for Next Fit algorithm in Memory Management\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite: Partition allocation methods What is Next Fit?

The unused portions of the program are kept on disk or other storage, and are loaded into memory as needed. This allows programs to be larger than the available memory, but still run smoothly.\n\nThe main problem in Fixed partitioning is the size of a process has to be limited by the maximum size of the partition, which means a process can never be span over another.In order to solve this problem, earlier people have used some solution which is called as Overlays.\n\nThe concept of **overlays** is that whenever a process is running it will not use the complete program at the same time, it will use only some part of it. Then overlays concept says that whatever part you required, you load it and once the part is done, then you just unload it, means just pull it back and get the new part you required and run it.\n\nFormally,\n\n\u201cThe process of **transferring a block** of program code or other data into internal memory, replacing what is already stored\u201d.\n\nSometimes it happens that compare to the size of the biggest partition, the size of the program will be even more, then, in that case, you should go with overlays.\n\nSo overlay is a technique to run a program that is bigger than the size of the physical memory by keeping only those instructions and data that are needed at any given time.Divide the program into modules in such a way that not all modules need to be in the memory at the same time.\n\n### Advantages of using overlays include:\n\n- Increased memory utilization: Overlays allow multiple programs to share the same physical memory space, increasing memory utilization and reducing the need for additional memory.\n- Reduced load time: Only the necessary parts of a program are loaded into memory, reducing load time and increasing performance.\n- Improved reliability: Overlays reduce the risk of memory overflow, which can cause crashes or data loss.\n- Reduce memory requirement\n- Reduce time requirement\n\n### Disadvantages of using overlays include:\n\n- Complexity: Overlays can be complex to implement and manage, especially for large programs.\n- Performance overhead: The process of loading and unloading overlays can result in increased CPU and disk usage, which can slow down performance.\n- Compatibility issues: Overlays may not work on all hardware and software configurations, making it difficult to ensure compatibility across different systems.\n- Overlap map must be specified by programmer\n- Programmer must know memory requirement\n- Overlapped module must be completely disjoint\n- Programming design of overlays structure is complex and not possible in all cases\n\n**Example \u2013**\n\nThe best example of overlays is assembler. Consider the assembler has 2 passes, 2 pass means at any time it will be doing only one thing, either the 1st pass or the 2nd pass. This means it will finish 1st pass first and then 2nd pass.Let assume that available main memory size is 150KB and total code size is 200KB\n\n```\nPass 1.......................70KB\nPass 2.......................80KB\nSymbol table.................30KB\nCommon routine...............20KB\n```\n\nAs the total code size is 200KB and main memory size is 150KB, it is not possible to use 2 passes together.So, in this case, we should go with the overlays technique.According to the overlays concept at any time only one pass will be used and both the passes always need symbol table and common routine.Now the question is if overlays-driver\\* is 10KB, then what is the minimum partition size required?For pass 1 total memory needed is = (70KB + 30KB + 20KB + 10KB) = 130KB and for pass 2 total memory needed is = (80KB + 30KB + 20KB + 10KB) = 140KB.So if we have minimum 140KB size partition then we can run this code very easily.\n\n\\*Overlays driver:-It is the user responsibility to take care of overlaying, the operating system will not provide anything.Which means the user should write even what part is required in the 1st pass and once the 1st pass is over, the user should write the code to pull out the pass 1 and load the pass 2.That is what is the responsibility of the user, that is known as the Overlays driver.Overlays driver will just help us to move out and move in the various part of the code.\n\n**Question \u2013**\n\nThe overlay tree for a program is as shown below:\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/os_overlaymemory.png)\n\nWhat will be the size of the partition (in physical memory) required to load (and\n\nrun) this program?\n\n(a) 12 KB (b) 14 KB (c) 10 KB (d) 8 KB\n\n**Explanation \u2013**\n\nUsing the overlay concept we need not actually have the entire program inside the main memory.Only we need to have the part which are required at that instance of time, either we need Root-A-D or Root-A-E or Root-B-F or Root-C-G part.\n\n```\nRoot+A+D = 2KB + 4KB + 6KB = 12KB\nRoot+A+E = 2KB + 4KB + 8KB = 14KB\nRoot+B+F = 2KB + 6KB + 2KB = 10KB\nRoot+C+G = 2KB + 8KB + 4KB = 14KB\n```\n\nSo if we have 14KB size of partition then we can run any of them.\n\nAnswer -(b) 14KB\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Swap Space in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth/avatar.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200717172614/authPreLogo.png)\n\nGeeksforGeeks\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n50\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Memory Allocation Techniques \\| Mapping Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite : Requirements of Memory Management System, Logical and Physical Address Memory Allocation Techniques:To store the data and to manage the processes, we need a large-sized memory and, at the same time, we need to access the data as fast as possible.

Normally, as more page frames are available, the operating system has more flexibility to keep the necessary pages in memory, which should reduce the number of page fault\n\nThis phenomenon is commonly experienced in the following page replacement algorithms:\n\n- First in first out (FIFO)\n- Second chance algorithm\n- Random page replacement algorithm\n\nA page fault occurs when a page is not found in the memory and needs to be loaded from the disk. If a page fault occurs and all memory frames have been already allocated, then the replacement of a page in memory is required at the request of a new page. This is referred to as demand-paging. The choice of which page to replace is specified by page replacement algorithms. The commonly used page replacement algorithms are FIFO, LRU, optimal page replacement algorithms, etc.\n\n## What is a Page Fault?\n\nA page fault is a type of interrupt or exception that occurs in a computer\u2019s operating system when a program attempts to access a page of memory that is not currently loaded into physical RAM (Random Access Memory). Instead, the page is stored on disk in a storage space called the page file or swap space.\n\nGenerally, on increasing the number of frames to a process\u2019 virtual memory, its execution becomes faster as fewer page faults occur. Sometimes the reverse happens, i.e. more page faults occur when more frames are allocated to a process. This most unexpected result is termed **Belady\u2019s Anomaly**.\n\n## **Reason for Belady\u2019s Anomaly**\n\nBelady\u2019s Anomaly happens because algorithms like FIFO replace pages based on their arrival order, without considering how often or soon they will be used again. Adding more frames can change the replacement order, causing frequently used pages to be evicted earlier and increasing page faults. This occurs due to the lack of awareness of future page references and the non-optimal nature of such algorithms.\n\nAlgorithms like Optimal and LRU (Least Recently Used) avoid Belady\u2019s Anomaly because:\n\n- They consider the future or past usage of pages.\n- They use a stack-based structure, ensuring that pages in smaller frame setups will also be present in larger setups, preventing anomalies.\n\nThe other two commonly used page replacement algorithms are Optimal and LRU, but Belady\u2019s Anomaly can never occur in these algorithms for any reference string as they belong to a class of stack-based page replacement algorithms.\n\nA **stack-based algorithm** is one for which it can be shown that the set of pages in memory for _N_ frames is always a subset of the set of pages that would be in memory with _N + 1_ frames. For LRU replacement, the set of pages in memory would be the _n_ most recently referenced pages. If the number of frames increases then these _n_ pages will still be the most recently referenced and so, will still be in the memory. While in FIFO, if a page named _b_ came into physical memory before a page \u2013 _a_ then priority of replacement of _b_ is greater than that of _a_, but this is not independent of the number of page frames and hence, FIFO does not follow a stack page replacement policy and therefore suffers Belady\u2019s Anomaly.\n\n**Example:** Consider the following diagram to understand the behavior of a stack-based page replacement algorithm\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/stackbased.png)\n\nThe diagram illustrates that given the set of pages i.e. {0, 1, 2} in 3 frames of memory is not a subset of the pages in memory \u2013 {0, 1, 4, 5} with 4 frames and it is a violation in the property of stack-based algorithms. This situation can be frequently seen in FIFO algorithm.\n\n## **Belady\u2019s Anomaly in FIFO**\n\nIn FIFO page replacement it is supposed that the number of page faults should be less when we increase the number of frames. But sometimes, when the number of page faults increases even after increasing the number of frames, \u201cBelady\u2019s Anomaly\u201d occurs.\n\nLet us understand this condition using a graph:\n\n![1graph](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250117111711375404/1graph.webp)\n\nLet us understand Belady\u2019s Anomaly in FIFO using an example:\n\nAssuming a system that has no pages loaded in the memory and uses the FIFO Page replacement algorithm. Consider the following reference string:\n\n```\n1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n```\n\n**Case-1:** If the system has 3 frames, the given reference string the using FIFO page replacement algorithm yields a total of 9 page faults. The diagram below illustrates the pattern of the page faults occurring in the example.\n\n![Belady Anomaly - FIFO](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fifo3.png)\n\n**Case-2:** If the system has 4 frames, the given reference string using the [FIFO page replacement algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-page-replacement-algorithms-set-2-fifo/) yields a total of 10 page faults. The diagram below illustrates the pattern of the page faults occurring in the example.\n\n![Belady Anomaly - FIFO](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fifo4.png)\n\nIt can be seen from the above example that on increasing the number of frames while using the FIFO page replacement algorithm, the number of **page faults increased** from 9 to 10.\n\n> **Note \u2013** It is not necessary that every string reference pattern cause Belady anomaly in FIFO but there is certain kind of string references that worsen the FIFO performance on increasing the number of frames.\n\n## **Why Stack Based Algorithms do not Suffer Anomaly?**\n\nAll the stack based algorithms never suffer Belady Anomaly because these type of algorithms assigns a priority to a page (for replacement) that is independent of the number of page frames. Examples of such policies are Optimal, LRU and LFU. Additionally these algorithms also have a good property for simulation, i.e. the miss (or hit) ratio can be computed for any number of page frames with a single pass through the reference string.\n\nIn LRU algorithm every time a page is referenced it is moved at the top of the stack, so, the top _n_ pages of the stack are the _n_ most recently used pages. Even if the number of frames is incremented to _n+1_, top of the stack will have _n+1_ most recently used pages.\n\nSimilar example can be used to calculate the number of page faults in LRU algorithm. Assuming a system that has no pages loaded in the memory and uses the LRU Page replacement algorithm. Consider the following reference string:\n\n```\n1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n```\n\n**Case-1:** If the system has 3 frames, the given reference string using the [LRU page replacement algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/) yields a total of 10 page faults. The diagram below illustrates the pattern of the page faults occurring in the example.\n\n![Belady Anomaly - Case 1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/LRU33.png)\n\n**Case-2:** If the system has 4 frames, the given reference string on using LRU page replacement algorithm, then total 8 page faults occur. The diagram shows the pattern of the page faults in the example.\n\n![Belady Anomaly - Case 2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/LRU44-1.png)\n\n## **How Can Belady\u2019s Anomaly Be Removed?**\n\nA stack-based approach can be used to get rid of Belady\u2019s Algorithm. These are some examples of such algorithms:\n\n- Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm\n- \u00a0Least Recently Used Algorithm (LRU)\n\nThese algorithms are based on the idea that if a page is inactive for a long time, it is not being utilised frequently. Therefore, it would be best to forget about this page. This allows for improvised memory management and the abolition of Belady\u2019s anomaly.\n\n**Conclusion :** Various factors substantially affect the number of page faults, such as reference string length and the number of free page frames available. Anomalies also occur due to the small cache size as well as the reckless rate of change of the contents of the cache. Also, the situation of a fixed number of page faults even after increasing the number of frames can also be seen as an anomaly. Often algorithms like **Random page replacement algorithm** are also susceptible to Belady\u2019s Anomaly, because it **may behave like first in first out (FIFO)** page replacement algorithm. But Stack based algorithms are generally immune to all such situations as they are guaranteed to give better page hits when the frames are incremented.\n\n## Features of Belady\u2019s Anomaly\n\n- **Page fault rate:** Page fault rate is the number of page faults that occur during the execution of a process. Belady\u2019s Anomaly occurs when the page fault rate increases as the number of page frames allocated to a process increases.\n\n- **Page replacement algorithm:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly is specific to some page replacement algorithms, including the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm and the Second-Chance algorithm.\n\n- **System workload:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can occur when the system workload changes. Specifically, it can happen when the number of page references in the workload increases.\n\n- **Page frame allocation:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can occur when the page frames allocated to a process are increased, but the total number of page frames in the system remains constant. This is because increasing the number of page frames allocated to a process reduces the number of page faults initially, but when the workload increases, the increased number of page frames can cause the process to evict pages from its working set more frequently, leading to more page faults.\n\n- **Impact on performance:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can significantly impact system performance, as it can result in a higher number of page faults and slower overall system performance. It can also make it challenging to choose an optimal number of page frames for a process.\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Better insight into algorithm behavior:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can provide insight into how a page replacement algorithm works and how it can behave in different scenarios. This can be helpful in designing and optimizing algorithms for specific use cases.\n\n- **Improved algorithm performance:** In some cases, increasing the number of frames allocated to a process can actually improve algorithm performance, even if it results in more page faults. This is because having more frames can reduce the frequency of page replacement, which can improve overall performance.\n\n## **Disadvantages**\n\n- **Poor predictability:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can make it difficult to predict how an algorithm will perform with different configurations of frames and pages, which can lead to unpredictable performance and system instability.\n\n- **Increased overhead:** In some cases, increasing the number of frames allocated to a process can result in increased overhead and resource usage, which can negatively impact system performance.\n\n- **Unintuitive behavior:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can result in unintuitive behavior, where increasing the number of frames allocated to a process results in more page faults, which can be confusing for users and system administrators.\n\n- **Difficulty in optimization:** Belady\u2019s Anomaly can make it difficult to optimize page replacement algorithms for specific use cases, as the behavior of the algorithm can be unpredictable and inconsistent.\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n- [Program to show Belady\u2019s Anomaly](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-show-beladys-anomaly/)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA page fault occurs when a program accesses a page not currently in [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/), triggering a process to load the page from disk. Belady\u2019s Anomaly describes the counterintuitive situation where increasing the number of memory frames can lead to more page faults with some algorithms, like FIFO. This anomaly highlights the importance of choosing efficient page replacement algorithms. Stack-based algorithms, such as LRU and Optimal, are immune to Belady\u2019s Anomaly and typically provide more predictable performance.\n\n## **GATE CS Corner Questions**\n\nPracticing the following questions will help you test your knowledge.

When a new page needs to be loaded intophysicalmemory **,** and there is no free space, these algorithms determine which existing page to replace.\n\nIf no page frame is free, the [virtual memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/) manager performs a page replacement operation to replace one of the pages existing in memory with the page whose reference caused the page fault. It is performed as follows: The virtual memory manager uses a page replacement algorithm to select one of the pages currently in memory for replacement, accesses the page table entry of the selected page to mark it as \u201cnot present\u201d in memory, and initiates a page-out operation for it if the modified bit of its page table entry indicates that it is a dirty page.\n\n## Common Page Replacement Techniques\n\n- First In First Out (FIFO)\n- Optimal Page replacement\n- Least Recently Used (LRU)\n- Most Recently Used (MRU)\n\n## **First In First Out (FIFO)**\n\nThis is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.\n\n**Example 1:** Consider page reference string 1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 6, 3 with 3-page frames. Find the number of page faults using FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm.\n\n![FIFO - Page Replacement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023184328270600/page1.jpg)\n\nFIFO \u2013 Page Replacement\n\n> Initially, all slots are empty, so when 1, 3, 0 came they are allocated to the empty slots \u2014> **3 Page Faults.**\n>\n> when 3 comes, it is already in memory so \u2014> 0 **Page Faults.** Then 5 comes, it is not available in memory, so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e 1. \u2014> 1 **Page Fault.** 6 comes,\u00a0it is also not available in memory, so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e 3 \u2014> 1 **Page Fault.** Finally, when 3 come it is not available, so it replaces 0 1-page **fault.**\n\n## Implementation of FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm\n\n- [Program for Page Replacement Algorithm (FIFO)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-page-replacement-algorithms-set-2-fifo/)\n\n## **Optimal Page Replacement**\n\nIn this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.\n\n**Example:** Consider the page references 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3 with 4-page frame. Find number of page fault using Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm.\n\n![Optimal Page Replacement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023184349191529/page2.jpg)\n\nOptimal Page Replacement\n\n> Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots \u2014> **4 Page faults**\n>\n> 0 is already there so \u2014> **0 Page fault.** when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is not used for the longest duration of time in the future\u2014> **1 Page fault.** 0 is already there so \u2014> **0 Page fault.** 4 will takes place of 1 \u2014> **1 Page Fault.**\n\nNow for the further page reference string \u2014> 0 **Page fault because** they are already available in the memory. [Optimal page replacement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replacement-algorithm/) is perfect, but not possible in practice as the operating system cannot know future requests. The use of Optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark so that other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it.\n\n## **Least Recently Used**\n\nIn this algorithm, page will be replaced which is least recently used.\n\n**Example** Consider the page reference string 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3 with 4-page frames. Find number of page faults using LRU Page Replacement Algorithm.\n\n![Least Recently Used - Page Replacement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023184405860059/page3.jpg)\n\nLeast Recently Used \u2013 Page Replacement\n\n> Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots \u2014> **4 Page faults**\n>\n> 0 is already there so \u2014> **0 Page fault.** when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is least recently used \u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> 0 is already in memory so \u2014> **0 Page fault**.\n>\n> 4 will takes place of 1 \u2014> **1 Page Fault**\n>\n> Now for the further page reference string \u2014> **0 Page fault** because they are already available in the memory.\n\n## Implementation of LRU Page Replacement Algorithm\n\n- [Program for Least Recently Used (LRU) Page Replacement algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)\n\n## **Most Recently Used (MRU)**\n\nIn this algorithm, page will be replaced which has been used recently. Belady\u2019s anomaly can occur in this algorithm.\n\n**Example 4:** Consider the page reference string 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3 with 4-page frames. Find number of page faults using MRU Page Replacement Algorithm.\n\n![Most Recently Used - Page Replacement](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20241023184428687727/page4.jpg)\n\nMost Recently Used \u2013 Page Replacement\n\n> Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots \u2014> **4 Page faults**\n>\n> 0 is already their so\u2013> **0 page fault**\n>\n> when 3 comes it will take place of 0 because it is most recently used \u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 0 comes it will take place of 3 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 4 comes it will take place of 0 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> 2 is already in memory so \u2014> **0 Page fault**\n>\n> when 3 comes it will take place of 2 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 0 comes it will take place of 3 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 3 comes it will take place of 0 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 2 comes it will take place of 3 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n>\n> when 3 comes it will take place of 2 \u00a0\u2014> **1 Page fault**\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, page replacement algorithms are essential for managing a computer\u2019s memory efficiently. They help ensure that the system runs smoothly by reducing the number of times it needs to fetch data from slower storage. Different algorithms, like [FIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-first-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/) and [LRU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/), have their own pros and cons, and choosing the right one depends on the specific needs of the system. Understanding these algorithms can help improve system performance and make our computers faster and more efficient.\n\n## **GATE CS Corner Questions**\n\nPracticing the following questions will help you test your knowledge.

It aims to improve upon FIFO\u2019s weakness of potentially evicting frequently used pages.\n\nIt can be implemented by adding a \u201csecond chance\u201d bit to each memory frame time the frame is considered (due to a reference made to the page inside it), this bit is set to 1, which gives the page a second chance, as when we consider the candidate page for replacement, we replace the first one with this bit set to 0 (while zeroing out bits of the other pages we see in the process). Thus, a page with the \u201csecond chance\u201d bit set to 1 is never replaced during the first consideration and will only be replaced if all the other pages deserve a second chance too.\n\nTraditionally Second Chance and Clock are believed to be less efficient than LRU (having a higher m ratio). Recent [research from Carnegie Mellon University finds](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593856.3595887) that Second Chance and Clock are more efficient than LRU with a lower miss ratio. Because Second Chance and Clock is faster and more scalable than LRU, this means LRU has no advantage over Second Chance and Clock anymore.\n\nFor more details refer: [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-page-replacement-algorithm/)\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s say the reference string is **0 4 1 4 2 4 3 4 2 4 0 4 1 4 2 4 3 4** and we have **3** frames. Let\u2019s see how the algorithm proceeds by tracking the second chance bit and the pointer.\n\n- Initially, all frames are empty so after the first 3 passes they will be filled with {0, 4, 1} and the second chance array will be {0, 0, 0} as none has been referenced yet. Also, the pointer will cycle back to 0.\n- **Pass-4:** Frame={0, 4, 1}, second\\_chance = {0, 1, 0} \\[4 will get a second chance\\], pointer = 0 (No page needed to be updated so the candidate is still page in frame 0), pf = 3 (No increase in page fault number).\n- **Pass-5:** Frame={2, 4, 1}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0} \\[0 replaced; it\u2019s second chance bit was 0, so it didn\u2019t get a second chance\\], pointer=1 (updated), pf=4\n- **Pass-6:** Frame={2, 4, 1}, second\\_chance={0, 1, 0}, pointer=1, pf=4 (No change)\n- **Pass-7:** Frame={2, 4, 3}, second\\_chance= {0, 0, 0} \\[4 survived but it\u2019s second chance bit became 0\\], pointer=0 (as element at index 2 was finally replaced), pf=5\n- **Pass-8:** Frame={2, 4, 3}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0} \\[4 referenced again\\], pointer=0, pf=5\n- **Pass-9:** Frame={2, 4, 3}, second\\_chance= {1, 1, 0} \\[2 referenced again\\], pointer=0, pf=5\n- **Pass-10:** Frame={2, 4, 3}, second\\_chance= {1, 1, 0}, pointer=0, pf=5 (no change)\n- **Pass-11:** Frame={2, 4, 0}, second\\_chance= {0, 0, 0}, pointer=0, pf=6 (2 and 4 got second chances)\n- **Pass-12:** Frame={2, 4, 0}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=0, pf=6 (4 will again get a second chance)\n- **Pass-13:** Frame={1, 4, 0}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=1, pf=7 (pointer updated, pf updated)\n- **Page-14:** Frame={1, 4, 0}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=1, pf=7 (No change)\n- **Page-15:** Frame={1, 4, 2}, second\\_chance= {0, 0, 0}, pointer=0, pf=8 (4 survived again due to 2nd chance!)\n- **Page-16:** Frame={1, 4, 2}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=0, pf=8 (2nd chance updated)\n- **Page-17:** Frame={3, 4, 2}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=1, pf=9 (pointer, pf updated)\n- **Page-18:** Frame={3, 4, 2}, second\\_chance= {0, 1, 0}, pointer=1, pf=9 (No change)\n\nIn this example, second chance algorithm does as well as the LRU method, which is much more expensive to implement in hardware.\n\n**More Examples:**\n\n```\nInput: 2 5 10 1 2 2 6 9 1 2 10 2 6 1 2 1 6 9 5 1\n3\nOutput: 13\n\nInput: 2 5 10 1 2 2 6 9 1 2 10 2 6 1 2 1 6 9 5 1\n4\nOutput: 11\n```\n\n## **Algorithm**\n\nCreate an array **frames** to track the pages currently in memory and another Boolean array **second\\_chance** to track whether that page has been accessed since it\u2019s last replacement (that is if it deserves a second chance or not) and a variable **pointer** to track the target for replacement.\n\n1. Start traversing the array **arr**. If the page already exists, simply set its corresponding element in **second\\_chance** to true and return.\n2. If the page doesn\u2019t exist, check whether the space pointed to by **pointer** is empty (indicating cache isn\u2019t full yet) \u2013 if so, we will put the element there and return, else we\u2019ll traverse the array **arr** one by one (cyclically using the value of **pointer**), marking all corresponding **second\\_chance** elements as false, till we find a one that\u2019s already false. That is the most suitable page for replacement, so we do so and return.\n3. Finally, we report the page fault count.\n\n![Page replacement policy](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/GFG-3.jpg)\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nC++`\n// CPP program to find largest in an array\n// without conditional/bitwise/ternary/ operators\n// and without library functions.\n#include<iostream>\n#include<cstring>\n#include<sstream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// If page found, updates the second chance bit to true\nstatic bool findAndUpdate(int x,int arr[],\n                bool second_chance[],int frames)\n{\n    int i;\n\n    for(i = 0;

Two common methods for allocating kernel memory are the buddy system and the slab system.\n\nThe buddy system is a memory allocation algorithm that works by dividing memory into blocks of a fixed size, with each block being a power of two in size. When a request for memory is made, the algorithm finds the smallest available block of memory that is large enough to satisfy the request. If the block is larger than the requested size, it is split into two smaller blocks of equal size (the \u201cbuddies\u201d), with each buddy being marked as either allocated or free. The algorithm then continues recursively until it finds the exact size of the requested memory or a block that is the smallest possible size.\n\nThe slab system is a memory allocation algorithm that is designed specifically for kernel memory. It works by dividing memory into fixed-size caches or slabs, each of which contains a set of objects of the same type. When a request for memory is made, the algorithm first checks if there is an available object in the appropriate slab cache. If there is, the object is returned. If not, the algorithm allocates a new slab and adds it to the appropriate cache.\n\nThe advantages of the buddy system are that it is easy to implement and can handle a wide range of memory sizes. The disadvantages are that it can lead to memory fragmentation and that it can be inefficient for allocating small amounts of memory.\n\nThe advantages of the slab system are that it is efficient for allocating small amounts of memory and that it can prevent memory fragmentation. The disadvantages are that it can be more complex to implement than the buddy system and that it may require more memory overhead.\n\nOverall, both the buddy system and the slab system are effective methods for allocating kernel memory, and the choice between the two depends on the specific needs and requirements of the operating system being developed.\n\nTwo strategies for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes:\n\n### 1\\. Buddy system \u2013\n\nBuddy allocation system is an algorithm in which a larger memory block is divided into small parts to satisfy the request. This algorithm is used to give best fit. The two smaller parts of block are of equal size and called as buddies. In the same manner one of the two buddies will further divide into smaller parts until the request is fulfilled. Benefit of this technique is that the two buddies can combine to form the block of larger size according to the memory request.\n\n_Example \u2013_ If the request of 25Kb is made then block of size 32Kb is allocated.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/bud-1.jpg)\n\n**Four Types of Buddy System \u2013**\n\n1. Binary buddy system\n2. Fibonacci buddy system\n3. Weighted buddy system\n4. Tertiary buddy system\n\n**Why buddy system?**\n\nIf the partition size and process size are different then poor match occurs and may use space inefficiently.\n\nIt is easy to implement and efficient then dynamic allocation.\n\n**Binary buddy system \u2013**\n\nThe buddy system maintains a list of the free blocks of each size (called a free list), so that it is easy to find a block of the desired size, if one is available. If no block of the requested size is available, Allocate searches for the first non-empty list for blocks of atleast the size requested. In either case, a block is removed from the free list.\n\n**Example \u2013** Assume the size of memory segment is initially 256kb and the kernel requests 25kb of memory. The segment is initially divided into two buddies. Let we call A1 and A2 each 128kb in size. One of these buddies is further divided into two 64kb buddies let say B1 and B2. But the next highest power of 25kb is 32kb so, either B1 or B2 is further divided into two 32kb buddies(C1 and C2) and finally one of these buddies is used to satisfy the 25kb request. A split block can only be merged with its unique buddy block, which then reforms the larger block they were split from.\n\n**Fibonacci buddy system \u2013**\n\nThis is the system in which blocks are divided into sizes which are Fibonacci numbers. It satisfies the following relation:\n\n```\n  Zi = Z(i-1)+Z(i-2)\n```\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 144, 233, 377, 610. The address calculation for the binary and weighted buddy systems is straight forward, but the original procedure for the Fibonacci buddy system was either limited to a small, fixed number of block sizes or a time consuming computation.\n\n**Advantages \u2013**\n\n- In comparison to other simpler techniques such as dynamic allocation, the buddy memory system has little external fragmentation.\n- The buddy memory allocation system is implemented with the use of a binary tree to represent used or unused split memory blocks.\n- The buddy system is very fast to allocate or deallocate memory.\n- In buddy systems, the cost to allocate and free a block of memory is low compared to that of best-fit or first-fit algorithms.\n- Other advantage is coalescing.\n- Address calculation is easy.\n- Efficient memory management: Kernel memory allocators are designed to efficiently manage memory resources, ensuring that memory is allocated and deallocated in a way that minimizes fragmentation and maximizes available space.\n- Customizable allocation policies: Kernel memory allocators can be customized to implement specific allocation policies, such as best fit, worst fit, or first fit. This allows for more precise control over memory usage and allocation.\n- High performance: Kernel memory allocators are typically designed for high-performance systems, allowing for fast and efficient allocation and deallocation of memory.\n- Reduced memory overhead: Memory allocators can reduce memory overhead by allowing for more efficient use of memory resources, reducing the overall memory footprint of the system.\n- Improved system stability: Efficient memory management can help improve system stability by reducing the likelihood of memory leaks, crashes, and other issues related to memory allocation.\n\nOverall, using a kernel memory allocator can help improve system performance, stability, and memory management, making it an essential component of any operating system.\n\n**What is coalescing?**\n\nIt is defined as how quickly adjacent buddies can be combined to form larger segments this is known as coalescing.\n\nFor example, when the kernel releases the C1 unit it was allocated, the system can coalesce C1 and C2 into a 64kb segment. This segment B1 can in turn be coalesced with its buddy B2 to form a 128kb segment. Ultimately we can end up with the original 256kb segment.\n\n**Drawback \u2013**\n\nThe main drawback in buddy system is internal fragmentation as larger block of memory is acquired then required. For example if a 36 kb request is made then it can only be satisfied by 64 kb segment and remaining memory is wasted.\n\n### 2\\. Slab Allocation \u2013\n\nA second strategy for allocating kernel memory is known as slab allocation. It eliminates fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. This method is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. In slab allocation memory chunks suitable to fit data objects of certain type or size are preallocated. Cache does not free the space immediately after use although it keeps track of data which are required frequently so that whenever request is made the data will reach very fast. Two terms required are:\n\n- **Slab \u2013** A slab is made up of one or more physically contiguous pages. The slab is the actual container of data associated with objects of the specific kind of the containing cache.\n- **Cache \u2013** Cache represents a small amount of very fast memory. A cache consists of one or more slabs. There is a single cache for each unique kernel data structure.\n\n![12](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/12-3.jpg)\n\n**Example \u2013**\n\n- A separate cache for a data structure representing processes descriptors\n- Separate cache for file objects\n- Separate cache for semaphores etc.\n\nEach cache is populated with objects that are instantiations of the kernel data structure the cache represents. For example the cache representing semaphores stores instances of semaphore objects, the cache representing process descriptors stores instances of process descriptor objects.\n\n**Implementation \u2013**\n\nThe slab allocation algorithm uses caches to store kernel objects. When a cache is created a number of objects which are initially marked as free are allocated to the cache. The number of objects in the cache depends on size of the associated slab.\n\n_Example \u2013_ A 12 kb slab (made up of three contiguous 4 kb pages) could store six 2 kb objects. Initially all objects in the cache are marked as free. When a new object for a kernel data structure is needed, the allocator can assign any free object from the cache to satisfy the request. The object assigned from the cache is marked as used.\n\nIn linux, a slab may in one of three possible states:\n\n1. **Full \u2013** All objects in the slab are marked as used\n2. **Empty \u2013** All objects in the slab are marked as free\n3. **Partial \u2013** The slab consists of both\n\nThe slab allocator first attempts to satisfy the request with a free object in a partial slab. If none exists, a free object is assigned from an empty slab. If no empty slabs are available, a new slab is allocated from contiguous physical pages and assigned to a cache.\n\n**Benefits of slab allocator \u2013**\n\n- No memory is wasted due to fragmentation because each unique kernel data structure has an associated cache.\n- Memory request can be satisfied quickly.\n- The slab allocating scheme is particularly effective for managing when objects are frequently allocated or deallocated. The act of allocating and releasing memory can be a time consuming process. However, objects are created in advance and thus can be quickly allocated from the cache. When the kernel has finished with an object and releases it, it is marked as free and return to its cache, thus making it immediately available for subsequent request from the kernel.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-system-memory-allocation-technique/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Buddy System - Memory Allocation Technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/buddy-system-memory-allocation-technique/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shubham%20tyagi%204/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[shubham tyagi 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/shubham%20tyagi%204/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n13\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n- [Technical Scripter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/technical-scripter/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Allocating kernel memory (buddy system and slab system)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nPrerequisite - Buddy System Introduction: Allocating kernel memory is a critical task in operating system design, as the kernel needs to manage memory efficiently and effectively to ensure optimal system performance.

After generating the object code, the compiler also invokes linker. One of the main tasks for linker is to make code of library functions (eg printf(), scanf(), sqrt(), ..etc) available to your program.\n\nA linker can accomplish this task in two ways, by copying the code of library function to your object code, or by making some arrangements so that the complete code of library functions is not copied, but made available at run-time.\n\n**Static Linking and Static Libraries**\n\nis the result of the linker making copy of all used library functions to the executable file. Static Linking creates larger binary files, and need more space on disk and main memory. Examples of static libraries (libraries which are statically linked) are,\n\n_**.a**_\n\nfiles in Linux and\n\n_**.lib**_\n\nfiles in Windows.\n\n**Steps to create a static library**\n\nLet us create and use a Static Library in UNIX or UNIX like OS.\n\n**1.**\n\nCreate a C file that contains functions in your library.\n\n- C\n\n## C\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `/* Filename: lib_mylib.c */`<br>`#include <stdio.h>`<br>`void` `fun(` `void` `)`<br>`{`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0``printf` `(\"fun() called from a ` `static` `library\");`<br>`}` |\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\nWe have created only one file for simplicity. We can also create multiple files in a library.\n\n**2.**\n\nCreate a header file for the library\n\n- C\n\n## C\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `/* Filename: lib_mylib.h */`<br>`void` `fun(` `void` `);` |\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n**3\\.**\n\nCompile library files.\n\n```\n gcc -c lib_mylib.c -o lib_mylib.o\n\n```\n\n**4\\.**\n\nCreate static library. This step is to bundle multiple object files in one static library (see\n\n[ar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_(Unix))\n\nfor details). The output of this step is static library.\n\n```\n ar rcs lib_mylib.a lib_mylib.o\n\n```\n\n**5\\.**\n\nNow our static library is ready to use. At this point we could just copy lib\\_mylib.a somewhere else to use it. For demo purposes, let us keep the library in the current directory.\n\n**Let us create a driver program that uses above created static library**\n\n.\n\n**1.**\n\nCreate a C file with main function\n\n- C\n\n## C\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| `/* filename: driver.c\u00a0 */`<br>`#include \"lib_mylib.h\"`<br>`void` `main() `<br>`{`<br>`\u00a0\u00a0``fun();`<br>`}` |\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n```\n\n**2.**\n\nCompile the driver program.\n\n```\ngcc -c driver.c -o driver.o\n\n```\n\n**3.**\n\nLink the compiled driver program to the static library. Note that -L\n\n**.**\n\nis used to tell that the static library is in current folder (See\n\n[this](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html)\n\nfor details of -L and -l options).\n\n```\ngcc -o driver driver.o -L. lib_mylib.a\n\n```\n\n**4.**\n\nRun the driver program\n\n```\n./driver\nfun() called from a static library\n\n```\n\nFollowing are some important points about static libraries.\n\n**1.**\n\nFor a static library, the actual code is extracted from the library by the linker and used to build the final executable at the point you compile/build your application.\n\n**2\\.**\n\nEach process gets its own copy of the code and data. Where as in case of dynamic libraries it is only code shared, data is specific to each process. For static libraries memory footprints are larger. For example, if all the window system tools were statically linked, several tens of megabytes of RAM would be wasted for a typical user, and the user would be slowed down by a lot of paging.\n\n**3.**\n\nSince library code is connected at compile time, the final executable has no dependencies on the library at run time i.e. no additional run-time loading costs, it means that you don\u2019t need to carry along a copy of the library that is being used and you have everything under your control and there is no dependency.\n\n**4\\.**\n\nIn static libraries, once everything is bundled into your application, you don\u2019t have to worry that the client will have the right library (and version) available on their system.\n\n**5.**\n\nOne drawback of static libraries is, for any change(up-gradation) in the static libraries, you have to recompile the main program every time.\n\n**6.**\n\nOne major advantage of static libraries being preferred even now \u201cis speed\u201d. There will be no dynamic querying of symbols in static libraries. Many production line software use static libraries even today.\n\n**Dynamic linking and Dynamic Libraries**\n\nDynamic Linking doesn\u2019t require the code to be copied, it is done by just placing name of the library in the binary file. The actual linking happens when the program is run, when both the binary file and the library are in memory. Examples of Dynamic libraries (libraries which are linked at run-time) are,\n\n_**.so**_\n\nin Linux and\n\n_**.dll**_\n\nin Windows.

If you are interested in systems related stuff, just read on\u2026\n\nShared libraries are useful in sharing code which is common across many applications. For example, it is more economic to pack all the code related to TCP/IP implementation in a shared library. However, data can\u2019t be shared as every application needs its own set of data. Applications like, browser, ftp, telnet, etc\u2026 make use of the shared \u2018network\u2019 library to elevate specific functionality.\n\nEvery operating system has its own representation and tool-set to create\u00a0shared libraries. More or less the concepts are same. On Windows every object file (\\*.obj, \\*.dll, \\*.ocx, \\*.sys, \\*.exe etc\u2026) follow a format called Portable Executable. Even shared libraries (called as Dynamic Linked Libraries or DLL in short) are also represented in PE format. The tool-set that is used to create these libraries need to understand the binary format. Linux variants follow a format called Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). The ELF files are position independent (PIC) format. Shared libraries in Linux are referred as shared objects (generally with extension \\*.so). These are similar to DLLs in Windows platform. Even shared object files follow the ELF binary format.\n\nRemember, the file extensions (\\*.dll, \\*.so, \\*.a, \\*.lib, etc\u2026) are just for programmer convenience. They don\u2019t have any significance. All these are binary files. You can name them as you wish. Yet ensure you provide absolute paths in building applications.\n\nIn general, when we compile an application the steps are simple. Compile, Link and Load. However, it is not simple. These steps are more versatile on modern operating systems.\n\nWhen you link your application against static library, the code is part of your application. There is no dependency. Even though it causes the application size to increase, it has its own advantages. The primary one is speed as there will be no symbol (a program entity) resolution at runtime. Since every piece of code part of the binary image, such applications are independent of version mismatch issues. However, the cost is on fixing an issue in library code. If there is any bug in library code, entire application need to be recompiled and shipped to the client. In case of dynamic libraries, fixing or upgrading the libraries is easy. You just need to ship the updated shared libraries. The application need not to recompile, it only need to re-run. You can design a mechanism where we don\u2019t need to restart the application.\n\nWhen we link an application against a shared library, the linker leaves some stubs (unresolved symbols) to be filled at application loading time. These stubs need to be filled by a tool called, _dynamic linker_ at run time or at application loading time. Again\u00a0loading of a library is of two types, static loading and dynamic loading. Don\u2019t confuse between _**static loading**_ vs _**static linking**_ and _**dynamic loading**_ vs _**dynamic linking**_.\n\nFor example, you have built an application that depends on _libstdc++.so_ which is a shared object (dynamic library). How does the application become aware of required shared libraries? (If you are interested, explore the tools _tdump_ from Borland tool set, _objdump_ or _nm_ or _readelf_ tools on Linux).\n\nStatic loading:\n\n- In static loading, all of those dependent shared libraries are loaded into memory even before the application starts execution. If loading of any shared library fails, the application won\u2019t run.\n- A dynamic loader examines application\u2019s dependency on shared\u00a0libraries. If these libraries are already loaded into the memory, the library address space is mapped to application virtual address space (VAS) and the dynamic linker does relocation of unresolved symbols.\n- If these libraries are not loaded into memory (perhaps your application might be first to invoke the shared library), the loader searches in standard library paths and loads them into memory, then maps and resolves symbols. Again loading is big process, if you are interested write your own loader :).\n- While resolving the symbols, if the dynamic linker not able to find any symbol (maybe due to older version of shared library), the application can\u2019t be started.\n\nDynamic Loading:\n\n- As the name indicates, dynamic loading is about loading of library on demand.\n- For example, if you want a small functionality from a shared library. Why should it be loaded at the application load time and sit in the memory? You can invoke loading of these shared libraries dynamically when you need their functionality. This is called dynamic loading. In this case, the programmer aware of situation \u2018when should the library be loaded\u2019. The tool-set and\u00a0relevant\u00a0kernel provides API to support dynamic loading, and querying of symbols in the shared library.\n\nMore details in later articles.\n\n_Note: If you come across terms like loadable modules or\u00a0equivalent\u00a0terms, don\u2019t mix them with shared libraries. They are different from shared\u00a0libraries\u00a0 The kernels provide framework to support loadable modules._\n\n[**Working with Shared Libraries \\| Set 2**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-with-shared-libraries-set-2/)\n\n**Exercise:**\n\n1\\.

Unlike unnamed pipes, which are temporary and exist only as long as the process that created them is running, named pipes provide a persistent communication channel between processes, surviving beyond the life of the process that created them. This makes named pipes an essential tool for developers who need processes to exchange data reliably and efficiently.\n\n## What is a Named Pipe (FIFO)?\n\nA named pipe is an extension of the traditional pipe concept in Unix. While a **traditional pipe** is \u201cunnamed\u201d and exists only temporarily, a **named pipe** can persist as long as the system is up or until it is explicitly deleted. Named pipes appear as special files in the filesystem, and multiple processes can attach to them for reading and writing, facilitating inter-process communication.\n\nA FIFO file allows two or more processes to communicate by reading from and writing to the same file. This file type is created using the \u2018 **mkfifo()\u2019** system call in C. Once created, any process can open the named pipe for reading or writing, similar to how it would handle an ordinary file. However, it is important to note that a named pipe must be opened simultaneously at both ends (for reading and writing) before any input or output operations can occur.\n\n## How to Create a Named Pipe (FIFO) in Unix\n\nTo create a FIFO special file, you use the \u2018 **mkfifo()\u2019** function in C. The function creates a named pipe with the specified pathname and permissions.\n\nCPP`\nint mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);\n`\n\n**\u2018mkfifo()\u2019** makes a FIFO special file with name _**pathname**_. Here \u2018 **mode\u2019** specifies the FIFO\u2019s permissions. It is modified by the process\u2019s umask in the usual way: the permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).\n\n**Using FIFO:** As named pipe(FIFO) is a kind of file, we can use all the system calls associated with it i.e. **open, read, write, close**.\n\n**Example Programs to illustrate the named pipe:** There are two programs that use the same FIFO. **Program 1** writes first, then reads. The **program 2** reads first, then writes. They both keep doing it until terminated.\n\n### 1\\. Program 1(Writes first)\n\nC`\n// C program to implement one side of FIFO\n// This side writes first, then reads\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\nint main()\n{\n    int fd;\n    // FIFO file path\n    char * myfifo = \"/tmp/myfifo\";\n    // Creating the named file(FIFO)\n    // mkfifo(<pathname>, <permission>)\n    mkfifo(myfifo, 0666);\n    char arr1[80], arr2[80];\n    while (1)\n    {\n        // Open FIFO for write only\n        fd = open(myfifo, O_WRONLY);\n        // Take an input arr2ing from user.\n        // 80 is maximum length\n        fgets(arr2, 80, stdin);\n        // Write the input arr2ing on FIFO\n        // and close it\n        write(fd, arr2, strlen(arr2)+1);\n        close(fd);\n        // Open FIFO for Read only\n        fd = open(myfifo, O_RDONLY);\n        // Read from FIFO\n        read(fd, arr1, sizeof(arr1));\n        // Print the read message\n        printf(\"User2: %s\n\", arr1);\n        close(fd);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n`\n\n### 2\\. Program 2(Reads First)\n\nC`\n// C program to implement one side of FIFO\n// This side reads first, then reads\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <sys/types.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\nint main()\n{\n    int fd1;\n    // FIFO file path\n    char * myfifo = \"/tmp/myfifo\";\n    // Creating the named file(FIFO)\n    // mkfifo(<pathname>,<permission>)\n    mkfifo(myfifo, 0666);\n    char str1[80], str2[80];\n    while (1)\n    {\n        // First open in read only and read\n        fd1 = open(myfifo,O_RDONLY);\n        read(fd1, str1, 80);\n        // Print the read string and close\n        printf(\"User1: %s\n\", str1);\n        close(fd1);\n        // Now open in write mode and write\n        // string taken from user.\n        fd1 = open(myfifo,O_WRONLY);\n        fgets(str2, 80, stdin);\n        write(fd1, str2, strlen(str2)+1);\n        close(fd1);\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n`\n\n**Output:** Run the two programs simultaneously on two terminals.\n\n![pic1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic19.png)![pic2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic23.png)![pic3](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic32.png)![pic4](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic42.png)![pic5](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic52.png)![pic6](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic62.png)![pic7](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic71.png)![pic8](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pic81.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Named pipes (FIFOs) are a robust method for the inter-process communication allowing data to be passed between the processes using a named file. This mechanism is useful in the scenarios where processes need to exchange data without direct knowledge of the each other. The example demonstrates a simple producer-consumer model where one process writes data to a [FIFO](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fifo-first-in-first-out-approach-in-programming/) and another reads it showcasing the basic usage of the named pipes in C.\n\n## Named Pipe or FIFO with Example C Program \u2013 FAQs\n\n### What is the primary difference between a named pipe and an unnamed pipe?\n\n> The Named pipes (FIFOs) have a name in the file system and can be used by the unrelated processes while unnamed pipes are temporary and used for the communication between the processes with a common ancestor.\n\n### How do I handle errors when working with FIFOs?\n\n> Always check the return values of the system calls like mkfifo(), open(), write() and read(). Use perror() or strerror() to get a descriptive error message for the debugging.\n\n### Can multiple processes write to or read from the same FIFO?\n\n> Yes, multiple processes can write to or read from the same FIFO. However, data written to a FIFO is read in the order it was written and synchronization mechanisms may be needed to the handle concurrent access properly.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-demonstrate-fork-and-pipe/?ref=next_article)\n\n[C Program to Demonstrate fork() and pipe()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-demonstrate-fork-and-pipe/?ref=next_article)\n\nK\n\nKishlay Verma\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n32\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [C Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/programming-language/c/?ref=article_category)\n- [Linux-Unix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/linux-unix/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Named Pipe or FIFO with example C program\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn computing, a named pipe, also known as a FIFO (First In, First Out), is a powerful mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC).

It performs programmed computation with accuracy and speed. Or in other words, the computer takes data as input and stores the data/instructions in the memory (use them when required). After processes the data, it converts into information. Finally, gives the output.\n\nHere, input refers to the raw data that we want the machine to process and return to us as a result, output refers to the response that the machine provides in response to the raw data entered and the processing of data may involve analyzing, searching, distributing, storing data, etc. Thus, we can also call a computer data processing system.\n\n## What is Computer Memory?\n\n[Computer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-computer-and-its-operations/) memory is just like the human brain. It is used to store [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/)/information and [instructions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-instructions/). It is a [data storage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-storage-and-its-sorts/) unit or a data [storage device](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-a-storage-device-definition-types-examples/) where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. It can store both the input and output can be stored here.\n\n## Characteristics of Computer Memory\n\n- It is faster computer memory as compared to secondary memory.\n- It is [semiconductor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semiconductors-and-their-importance/) memories.\n- It is usually a volatile memory, and main memory of the computer.\n- A computer system cannot run without primary memory.\n\n## How Does Computer Memory Work?\n\nWhen you open a program, it is loaded from secondary memory into primary memory. Because there are various types of memory and storage, an example would be moving a program from a [solid-state drive (SSD)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-solid-state-drive-ssd/) to RAM. Because primary storage is accessed more quickly, the opened software can connect with the computer\u2019s processor more quickly. The primary memory is readily accessible from temporary memory slots or other storage sites.\n\nMemory is volatile, which means that data is only kept temporarily in memory. Data saved in volatile memory is automatically destroyed when a computing device is turned off. When you save a file, it is sent to secondary memory for storage.\n\nThere are various kinds of memory accessible. It\u2019s operation will depend upon the type of primary memory used. but normally, semiconductor-based memory is more related with memory. Semiconductor memory made up of [IC (integrated circuits)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-integrated-circuits/) with silicon-based metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors.\n\n## Types of Computer Memory\n\nIn general, computer memory is of three types:\n\n- [Primary memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/primary-memory/)\n- [Secondary memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/secondary-memory/)\n- [Cache memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cache-memory/)\n\nNow we discuss each type of memory one by one in detail:\n\n### **1\\. Primary Memory**\n\nIt is also known as the main memory of the computersystem. It is used to store data and [programs or instructions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-program-and-instruction/) during [computer operations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-of-computer-and-its-operations/). It uses semiconductor technology and hence is commonly called semiconductor memory. Primary memory is of two types:\n\n- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** It is a volatile memory. Volatile memory stores information based on the power supply. If the power supply fails/ interrupted/stopped, all the data and information on this memory will be lost. [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/) is used for booting up or start the computer. It temporarily stores [programs/data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-program-and-data/) which has to be executed by the [processor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/role-of-processor-in-a-pc/). RAM is of two types:\n  - **S RAM (Static RAM):** [S RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sram-full-form/) uses transistors and the circuits of this memory are capable of retaining their state as long as the power is applied. This memory consists of the number of flip flops with each flip flop storing 1 bit. It has less access time and hence, it is faster.\n  - **D RAM (Dynamic RAM):** [D RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dram-full-form/) uses capacitors and transistors and stores the data as a charge on the capacitors. They contain thousands of memory cells. It needs refreshing of charge on capacitor after a few milliseconds. This memory is slower than S RAM.\n- **ROM (Read Only Memory):** It is a non-volatile memory. Non-volatile memory stores information even when there is a power supply failed/ interrupted/stopped. [ROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-only-memory-rom/) is used to store information that is used to operate the system. As its name refers to read-only memory, we can only read the programs and data that is stored on it. It contains some electronic fuses that can be programmed for a piece of specific information. The information stored in the ROM in binary format. It is also known as permanent memory. ROM is of four types:\n  - **MROM(Masked ROM):** Hard-wired devices with a pre-programmed collection of data or instructions were the first ROMs. Masked ROMs are a type of low-cost ROM that works in this way.\n  - **PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory):** This read-only memory is modifiable once by the user. The user purchases a blank PROM and uses a [PROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prom-full-form/) program to put the required contents into the PROM. Its content can\u2019t be erased once written.\n  - **EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):** [EPROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eprom-full-form/) is an extension to PROM where you can erase the content of ROM by exposing it to Ultraviolet rays for nearly 40 minutes.\n  - **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):** Here the written contents can be erased electrically. You can delete and reprogramme [EEPROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eeprom-full-form/) up to 10,000 times. Erasing and programming take very little time, i.e., nearly \u00a04 -10 ms(milliseconds). Any area in an EEPROM can be wiped and programmed selectively.\n\n### **2\\. Secondary Memory**\n\nIt is also known as auxiliary memory and [backup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backup-and-restore/) memory. It is a non-volatile memory and used to store a large amount of [data or information](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-information-and-data/). The data or information stored in secondary memory is permanent, and it is slower than primary memory. A [CPU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/central-processing-unit-cpu/) cannot access secondary memory directly. The data/information from the auxiliary memory is first transferred to the main memory, and then the CPU can access it.\n\n**Characteristics of Secondary Memory**\n\n- It is a slow memory but reusable.\n- It is a reliable and non-volatile memory.\n- It is cheaper than primary memory.\n- The storage capacity of secondary memory is large.\n- A computer system can run without secondary memory.\n- In secondary memory, data is stored permanently even when the power is off.\n\n**Types of Secondary Memory**\n\n**1\\. Magnetic Tapes:** [Magnetic tape](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/magnetic-tape-memory/) is a long, narrow strip of plastic film with a thin, magnetic coating on it that is used for magnetic recording. Bits are recorded on tape as magnetic patches called RECORDS that run along many tracks. Typically, 7 or 9 bits are recorded concurrently. Each track has one read/write head, which allows data to be recorded and read as a sequence of characters. It can be stopped, started moving forward or backward, or rewound.\n\n**2\\. Magnetic Disks:** A [magnetic disk](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/magnetic-disk-memory/) is a circular metal or a plastic plate and these plates are coated with magnetic material. The disc is used on both sides. Bits are stored in magnetized surfaces in locations called tracks that run in concentric rings. Sectors are typically used to break tracks into pieces.\n\n![Magnetic Disks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210601000012/ii1-300x226.png)\n\nHard discs are discs that are permanently attached and cannot be removed by a single user.\n\n**3\\. Optical Disks:** It\u2019s a laser-based storage medium that can be written to and read. It is reasonably priced and has a long lifespan. The [optical disc](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-optical-disks/) can be taken out of the computer by occasional users.\n\n**Types of Optical Disks**\n\n**CD \u2013 ROM**\n\n- It\u2019s called compact disk. Only read from memory.\n- Information is written to the disc by using a controlled laser beam to burn pits on the disc surface.\n- It has a highly reflecting surface, which is usually aluminium.\n- The diameter of the disc is 5.25 inches.\n- 16000 tracks per inch is the track density.\n- The capacity of a [CD-ROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cd-rom-full-form/) is 600 MB, with each sector storing 2048 bytes of data.\n- The data transfer rate is about 4800KB/sec. & the new access time is around 80 milliseconds.\n\n**WORM-(WRITE ONCE READ MANY)**\n\n- A user can only write data once.\n- The information is written on the disc using a laser beam.\n- It is possible to read the written data as many times as desired.\n- They keep lasting records of information but access time is high.\n- It is possible to rewrite updated or new data to another part of the disc.\n- Data that has already been written cannot be changed.\n- Usual size \u2013 5.25 inch or 3.5 inch diameter.\n- The usual capacity of 5.25 inch disk is 650 MB,5.2GB etc.\n\n**DVDs**\n\n- The term \u201c [DVD](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dvd-full-form/)\u201d stands for \u201cDigital Versatile/Video Disc,\u201d and there are two sorts of DVDs:\n  - DVDR (writable)\n  - DVDRW (Re-Writable)\n- **DVD-ROMS (Digital Versatile Discs)**: These are read-only memory (ROM) discs that can be used in a variety of ways. When compared to CD-ROMs, they can store a lot more data. It has a thick polycarbonate plastic layer that serves as a foundation for the other layers. It\u2019s an optical memory that can read and write data.\n- **DVD-R**: [DVD-R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dvd-r-full-form/) is a writable optical disc that can be used just once. It\u2019s a DVD that can be recorded. It\u2019s a lot like WORM. [DVD-ROMs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dvd-rom-full-form/) have capacities ranging from 4.7 to 17 GB. The capacity of 3.5 inch disk is 1.3 GB.\n\n### **3\\. Cache Memory**\n\nIt is a type of high-speed semiconductor memory that can help the CPU run faster. Between the CPU and the main memory, it serves as a buffer. It is used to store the data and programs that the CPU uses the most frequently.\n\n**Advantages of Cache Memory**\n\n- It is faster than the main memory.\n- When compared to the main memory, it takes less time to access it.\n- It keeps the programs that can be run in a short amount of time.\n- It stores data in temporary use.\n\n**Disadvantages of Cache Memory**\n\n- Because of the semiconductors used, it is very expensive.\n- The size of the cache (amount of data it can store) is usually small.\n\n## FAQs on Computer Memory\n\n### **Q.1: What is Volatile and Non Volatile memory?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Volatile memory is used to store information based on power supply. If the power supply is off, all the [data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data/) and information on this memory will be lost. For example, RAM (Random Access Memory). Whereas non-volatile memory is used to store information even when the power supply is off. For example, ROM (Read Only Memory).\n\n### **Q.2: How many 128 \\* 8 memory chips are required for a** **memory capacity of 4096\\*16?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> Number of chips required = Required RAM size/ Available chip capacity\n>\n> = (4096 \\* 16)/(128 \\* 8) = 64\n\n### **Q.3: Explain any four differences between RAM and ROM?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> | RAM | ROM |\n> | --- | --- |\n> | It stands for Random access memory. | It stands for read only memory. |\n> | It is the fastest memory. | It is slower memory as compare to RAM. |\n> | It is volatile memory. | It is non-volatile memory. |\n> | In this memory, data will erase when the power is off | In this memory, data will not erase even if the power is off |\n\n### **Q.4: How to erase data in EPROM?**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n> In [EPROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eprom-full-form/), using ultraviolet rays we can easily erase data.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Random Access Memory (RAM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram/?ref=next_article)\n\n[S](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sameekshakhandelwal1712/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[sameekshakhandelwal1712](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/sameekshakhandelwal1712/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n46\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [Class 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/class-6/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-learning/?ref=article_category)\n- [School Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/school-programming/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Digital Electronics and Logic Design Tutorials\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIn this Digital Electronics and Logic Design tutorial, we will dive deep into the fundamentals and advanced concepts of digital electronics and logic design.

It is like a backbone for many modern operating systems like Ubuntu, Solaris, Kali Linux, Arch Linux, and also POSIX. Originally, It was designed for developers only, UNIX played a most important role in the development and creation of the software and computing environments. Its distribution to government and academic institutions led to its widespread adoption across various types of hardware components. The core part of the UNIX system lies in its base Kernel, which is integral to its architecture, structure, and key functionality making it the heart of the operating system.\n\nThe basic design philosophy of UNIX is to provide simple, powerful tools that can be combined to perform complex tasks. It features a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system through a series of commands, rather than through a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n## Some of the Key Features of UNIX Include\n\n1. **Multiuser support:** UNIX allows multiple users to simultaneously access the same system and share resources.\n2. **Multitasking:** UNIX is capable of running multiple processes at the same time.\n3. **Shell scripting:** UNIX provides a powerful scripting language that allows users to automate tasks.\n4. **Security:** UNIX has a robust security model that includes file permissions, user accounts, and network security features.\n5. **Portability:** UNIX can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms, from small embedded systems to large mainframe computers.\n6. **Communication:** UNIX supports communication methods using the write command, mail command, etc.\n7. **Process Tracking:** UNIX maintains a record of the jobs that the user creates. This function improves system performance by monitoring CPU usage. It also allows you to keep track of how much disk space each user uses, and the use that information to regulate disk space.\n\nToday, UNIX is widely used in enterprise-level computing, scientific research, and web servers. Many modern operating systems, including Linux and macOS, are based on UNIX or its variants.\n\n![System Structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/2222-5.png)\n\n**Figure \u2013** System Structure\n\n- **Layer-1: Hardware:** It consists of all hardware related information.\n- **Layer-2: Kernel:** This is the core of the Operating System. It is a software that acts as the interface between the hardware and the software. Most of the tasks like memory management, file management, network management, process management, etc., are done by the kernel.\n- **Layer-3: Shell commands:** This is the interface between the user and the kernel. Shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at the terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want.\u00a0There are various commands like cp, mv, cat, grep, id, wc, nroff, a.out and more.\n- **Layer-4: Application Layer:** It is the outermost layer that executes the given external applications.\n\n![Kernel and Block Diagram](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/blockdiag.jpg)\n\n**Figure \u2013** Kernel and its Block Diagram\n\n**This diagram shows three levels: user, kernel, and hardware.**\n\n- The system call and library interface represent the border between user programs and the kernel. System calls look like ordinary function calls in C programs. Assembly language programs may invoke system calls directly without a system call library. The libraries are linked with the programs at compile time.\n\n- The set of system calls into those that interact with the file subsystem and some system calls interact with the process control subsystem. The file subsystem manages files, allocating file space, administering free space, controlling access to files, and retrieving data for users.\n\n- Processes interact with the file subsystem via a specific set of system calls, such as open (to open a file for reading or writing), close, read, write, stat (query the attributes of a file), chown (change the record of who owns the file), and chmod (change the access permissions of a file).\n\n- The file subsystem accesses file data using a buffering mechanism that regulates data flow between the kernel and secondary storage devices. The buffering mechanism interacts with block I/O device drivers to initiate data transfer to and from the kernel.\n\n- Device drivers are the kernel modules that control the operator of peripheral devices. The file subsystem also interacts directly with \u201craw\u201d I/O device drivers without the intervention of the buffering mechanism. Finally, the hardware control is responsible for handling interrupts and for communicating with the machine. Devices such as disks or terminals may interrupt the CPU while a process is executing. If so, the kernel may resume execution of the interrupted process after servicing the interrupt.\n\n- Interrupts are not serviced by special processes but by special functions in the kernel, called in the context of the currently running process.\n\n## **Difference** B **etween Unix and Linux**\n\n**Linux is essentially a clone of Unix. But, basic differences are shown below:**\n\n| Linux | Unix |\n| --- | --- |\n| The source code of Linux is freely available to its users | The source code of Unix is not freely available general public |\n| It has graphical user interface along with command line interface | It only has command line interface |\n| Linux OS is portable, flexible, and can be executed in different hard drives | Unix OS is not portable |\n| Different versions of Linux OS are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, RedHat Enterprise Linux, Solaris, etc. | Different version of Unix are AIS, HP-UX, BSD, Iris, etc. |\n| The file systems supported by Linux are as follows: xfs, ramfs, vfat, cramfsm, ext3, ext4, ext2, ext1, ufs, autofs, devpts, ntfs | The file systems supported by Unix are as follows: zfs, js, hfx, gps, xfs, vxfs |\n| Linux is an open-source operating system that was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. | Unix is a proprietary operating system that was originally developed by AT&T Bell Labs in the mid 1960s. |\n| The Linux kernel is monolithic, meaning that all of its services are provided by a single kernel. | The Unix kernel is modular, meaning that it is made up of a collection of independent modules that can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. |\n| Linux has much broader hardware support than Unix. | Unix was originally designed to run on large, expensive mainframe computers, while Linux was designed to run on commodity hardware like PCs and servers. |\n| User Interface of Linux is Graphical or text-based. | User Interface of unix is text-based. |\n| Command Line Interface of Linux is Bash, Zsh, Tcsh. | Command Line Interface of unix is Bourne, Korn, C, Zsh. |\n\n## Advantages of UNIX\n\n1. **Stability:** UNIX is known for its stability and reliability. It can run for long periods of time without requiring a reboot, which makes it ideal for critical systems that need to run continuously.\n2. **Security:** UNIX has a robust security model that includes file permissions, user accounts, and network security features. This makes it a popular choice for systems that require high levels of security.\n3. **Scalability:** UNIX can be scaled up to handle large workloads and can be used on a variety of hardware platforms.\n4. **Flexibility:** UNIX is highly customizable and can be configured to suit a wide range of needs. It can be used for everything from simple desktop systems to complex server environments.\n5. **Command-line interface:** UNIX\u2019s command-line interface allows for powerful and efficient interaction with the system.\n\n## Disadvantages of UNIX\n\n1. **Complexity:** UNIX can be complex and difficult to learn for users who are used to graphical user interfaces ( [GUIs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-graphical-user-interface/) ).\n2. **Cost:** Some UNIX systems can be expensive, especially when compared to open-source alternatives like Linux.\n3. **Lack of standardization:** There are many different versions of UNIX, which can make it difficult to ensure compatibility between different systems.\n4. **Limited software availability:** Some specialized software may not be available for UNIX systems.\n5. **Steep learning curve:** UNIX requires a certain level of technical knowledge and expertise, which can make it challenging for novice users.\n\n## Example of UNIX Command\n\n> \\# List files in a directory with detailed information\n>\n> ls -l\n\nThis command shows a detailed list of files and directories, including permissions of the logged in user, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, and timestamp thoroghly.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe **UNIX** operating system continues to be a milestone in the today\u2019s changing world of computing due it robustness, security, and flexibility. Its influence is seen in many and various operating systems, and its principles remain relevant as well as robust for understanding how an opereating systems works under the hood. By learning the **UNIX**, users can gain a valuable skill set including network security, cyber security , various file systems not only NTFS but also xfs, btrfs, ext4 etc. which is going to help user in many it Environment including Docker, kubernetes etc.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions on UNIX System \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **What are the main features of UNIX?**\n\n> UNIX is known for it\u2019s multiuser capability, multitasking, portability, security and hierarchial file system.

The microkernel provides very fundamental services required to run the OS like basic memory management, task scheduling, etc. Microkernels use **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** for communication. In this article, we will discuss Kernels, Microkernel, its architecture, etc.\n\n## What is Kernel?\n\nA Kernel is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources. It also acts as a bridge between the application and hardware of the computer. It is one of the first programs loaded on start-up (after the Bootloader).\n\nA Microkernel is one of the classifications of the kernel. Being a kernel it manages all system resources. But in a microkernel, the **user services** and **kernel services** are implemented in different address spaces. The user services are kept in **user address space**, and kernel services are kept under **kernel address space**, thus also reducing the size of the kernel and the size of the operating system as well.\n\n## ![Kernel](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/kernel.jpeg)What is a MicroKernel?\n\nMicrokernel is a type of Operating System that provides some basic services for an operating system/ These services include memory management, process scheduling, etc. Some other services like Device Drivers, File Systems, etc are managed by user-level processes. User Level Process communicates with Microkernel via message passing. This way of handling the process makes microkernels more modular and more flexible than traditional monolithic kernels.\n\nThe main advantage of a microkernel architecture is that it provides a more secure and stable operating system. Since only the most essential services run in kernel space, the attack surface of the operating system is reduced, making it more difficult for an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities. The main disadvantage of microkernel is that message passing between user-level processes can be slower than direct system calls in a monolithic kernel. This can affect the performance of the operating system, especially in high-performance applications.\n\n**Microkernels** provide a minimalist approach to operating system design by running only essential services in kernel space, making the OS more modular and secure.\n\nOverall, a microkernel architecture can provide a more secure and flexible operating system, but it may also come with some performance and complexity trade-offs. The choice between a microkernel and a monolithic kernel architecture depends on the specific needs and requirements of the operating system being developed.\n\n## **Kernel Mode and User Mode of CPU operation**\n\nThe CPU can execute certain instructions only when it is in kernel mode. These instructions are called privilege instructions. They allow the implementation of special operations whose execution by the user program could interface with the functioning of the operating system or activity of another user program. For example, instruction for managing memory protection.\n\n- The operating system puts the CPU in kernel mode when it is executing in the kernel so, that kernel can execute some special operation.\n- The operating system puts the CPU in user mode when a user program is in execution so, that the user program cannot interface with the operating system program.\n- User-level instruction does not require special privileges. Examples are ADD, PUSH, etc.\n\n![Transistion from user to kernel mode](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/box-2-1.jpg)\n\nThe concept of modes can be extended beyond two, requiring more than a single mode bit CPUs that support virtualization. It uses one of these extra bits to indicate when the virtual machine manager, VMM, is in control of the system. The VMM has more privileges than ordinary user programs, but not so many as the full kernel.\n\nSystem calls are typically implemented in the form of software interrupts, which causes the hardware\u2019s interrupt handler to transfer control over to an appropriate interrupt handler, which is part of the operating system, switching the bit mode to kernel mode in the process. The interrupt handler checks exactly which interrupt was generated, checks additional parameters ( generally passed through registers ) if appropriate, and then calls the appropriate kernel service routine to handle the service requested by the system call.\n\nUser programs\u2019 attempts to execute illegal instructions ( privileged or non-existent instructions ), or to access forbidden memory areas, also generate software interrupts, which are trapped by the interrupt handler, and control is transferred to the OS, which issues an appropriate error message, possibly dumps data to a log ( core ) file for later analysis, and then terminates the offending program.\n\nIt provides minimal services of process and memory management. The communication between client program/application and services running in user address space is established through message passing, reducing the speed of execution microkernel. The Operating System **remains unaffected** as user services and kernel services are isolated so if any user service fails it does not affect kernel service. Thus it adds to one of the advantages of a microkernel. It is easily **extendible** i.e. if any new services are to be added they are added to user address space and hence require no modification in kernel space. It is also portable, secure, and reliable.\u00a0Examples of microkernel-based operating systems include L4, QNX, and MINIX.\n\n## **Microkernel Architecture**\n\nSince the kernel is the core part of the operating system, so it is meant for handling the most important services only. Thus in this architecture, only the most important services are inside the kernel and the rest of the OS services are present inside the system application program. Thus users are able to interact with those not-so-important services within the system application. And the microkernel is solely responsible for the most important services of the operating system they are named as follows:\n\n- [Inter Process-Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)\n- [Memory Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-management-in-operating-system/)\n- [CPU-Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)\n\n![Microkernel Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Microkernel.jpeg)\n\n## Features of Microkernel-Based Operating System\n\n- **Minimal Core** : The kernel only manages basic tasks like CPU scheduling, memory management, and inter-process communication. All other services (like device drivers) run in user space, outside the kernel.\n- **Modularity** : System services are separated into independent modules. This makes it easy to update or replace individual components without affecting the entire system.\n- **Stability and Fault Isolation** : If a service like a device driver fails, it won\u2019t crash the whole system. Each service runs independently, so the core OS remains stable.\n- **Ease of Maintenance** : Since services are independent, fixing bugs or adding new features doesn\u2019t require major changes to the kernel itself, making maintenance easier.\n\n## **Advantages of Microkernel**\n\n- **Modularity:** Because the kernel and servers can be developed and maintained independently, the microkernel design allows for greater modularity. This can make adding and removing features and services from the system easier.\n- **Performance:** Because the kernel only contains the essential functions required to manage the system, the microkernel design can improve performance. This can make the system faster and more efficient.\n- **Security:** The microkernel design can improve security by reducing the system\u2019s attack surface by limiting the functions provided by the kernel. Malicious software may find it more difficult to compromise the system as a result of this.\n- **Reliability:** Microkernels are less complex than monolithic kernels, which can make them more reliable and less prone to crashes or other issues.\n- **Scalability:** Microkernels can be easily scaled to support different hardware architectures, making them more versatile.\n- **Portability:** Microkernels can be ported to different platforms with minimal effort, which makes them useful for [embedded systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-embedded-systems-set-1/) and other specialized applications.\n\n## Disadvantages of a Microkernel\n\n- **Slower Message Passing:** Slower message passing between user-level processes can affect performance, especially in high-performance applications.\n- **More Complex:** Increased complexity due to the modular design can make it more difficult to develop and maintain the [operating system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/) .\n- **Limited Performance:** Limited performance optimization due to separation of [kernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/) and user-level processes.\n- **Higher Memory Usage:** Higher memory usage compared to a monolithic kernel.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, a **microkernel** keeps the core of the operating system small and simple, which makes it more secure and stable. Since most functions run outside the kernel, it\u2019s easier to fix or update parts of the system without affecting everything else. A **microkernel** focuses on running only the most essential tasks in the core, such as managing memory and CPU, while leaving other services like device drivers and file systems to run outside in user space.\n\n## Microkernel in Operating Systems \u2013 FAQs\n\n### **How does a microkernel architecture make an operating system more modular and flexible?**\n\n> Services are implemented as user-level processes, which makes it easier to add, remove, or replace services without affecting other parts of the system. This makes it easier to customize the operating system to meet specific requirements.\n\n### **How does a microkernel differ from a monolithic kernel?**\n\n> A **monolithic kernel** handles all system services (device drivers, file systems, etc.) within the kernel itself, whereas a **microkernel** keeps only the essential tasks in the kernel and runs other services in user space, making the system more modular and secure.\n\n### **Why is a microkernel considered more secure?**\n\n> Since a microkernel has fewer components running in kernel space, there\u2019s less code that can be exploited by attackers. Services are isolated from one another, so even if one service is compromised, the core kernel remains unaffected.\n\n### **How does a microkernel handle system crashes?**\n\n> Since most services (like device drivers) run in **user space** and are separated from the kernel, a crash in one service doesn\u2019t bring down the entire system. The microkernel can continue running, and other services remain unaffected.\n\nComment\n\n\nMore info\n\n[Advertise with us](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/contact-us/?listicles)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[Kernel in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/?ref=next_article)\n\n[A](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/akash1295/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\n[akash1295](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/akash1295/contributions/?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article_author&itm_campaign=auth_user)\n\nFollow\n\n[![News](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/auth-dashboard-uploads/Google-news.svg)](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMLTrzwsw44bnAw?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen)\n\n105\n\nImprove\n\nArticle Tags :\n\n- [GATE CS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/gate-cs/?ref=article_category)\n- [Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/computer-subject/operating-systems/?ref=article_category)\n\n### Similar Reads\n\n[Microkernel in Operating Systems\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nA MicroKernel is an approach to designing an Operating System (OS).

Several services such as scheduling, caching, spooling, device reservation, and error handling \u2013 are provided by the kernel\u2019s I/O subsystem built on the hardware and device-driver infrastructure. The I/O subsystem is also responsible for protecting itself from errant processes and malicious users.\n\n1. **I/O Scheduling \u2013**\n\nTo schedule a set of I/O requests means to determine a good order in which to execute them. The order in which the application issues the system call is the best choice. Scheduling can improve the overall performance of the system, can share device access permission fairly to all the processes, and reduce the average waiting time, response time, and turnaround time for I/O to complete.\nOS developers implement schedules by maintaining a wait queue of the request for each device. When an application issues a blocking I/O system call, The request is placed in the queue for that device. The I/O scheduler rearranges the order to improve the efficiency of the system.\n\n2. **Buffering \u2013**\n\nA buffer is a memory area that stores data being transferred between two devices or between a device and an application. Buffering is done for three reasons.\n1. The first is to cope with a speed mismatch between the producer and consumer of a data stream.\n2. The second use of buffering is to provide adaptation for data that have different data-transfer sizes.\n3. The third use of buffering is to support copy semantics for the application I/O, \u201ccopy semantic \u201d means, suppose that an application wants to write data on a disk that is stored in its buffer. it calls the **write()** system\u2019s call, providing a pointer to the buffer and the integer specifying the number of bytes to write.\n3. **Caching \u2013**\n\nA _cache_ is a region of fast memory that holds a copy of data. Access to the cached copy is much easier than the original file. For instance, the instruction of the currently running process is stored on the disk, cached in physical memory, and copied again in the CPU\u2019s secondary and primary cache.\nThe main difference between a buffer and a cache is that a buffer may hold only the existing copy of a data item, while a cache, by definition, holds a copy on faster storage of an item that resides elsewhere.\n\n4. **Spooling and Device Reservation \u2013**\n\nA _spool_ is a buffer that holds the output of a device, such as a printer that cannot accept interleaved data streams. Although a printer can serve only one job at a time, several applications may wish to print their output concurrently, without having their output mixes together.\nThe OS solves this problem by preventing all output from continuing to the printer. The output of all applications is spooled in a separate disk file. When an application finishes printing then the spooling system queues the corresponding spool file for output to the printer.\n\n5. **Error Handling \u2013**\n\nAn Os that uses protected memory can guard against many kinds of hardware and application errors so that a complete system failure is not the usual result of each minor mechanical glitch, Devices, and I/O transfers can fail in many ways, either for transient reasons, as when a network becomes overloaded or for permanent reasons, as when a disk controller becomes defective.\n\n**Error Handling Strategies** : Ensuring robust error handling is a critical aspect of the Kernel I/O Subsystem to maintain the stability and reliability of the operating system. The strategies employed for error handling involve mechanisms for detecting, reporting, and recovering from I/O errors. Below are key components of error handling strategies within the Kernel I/O Subsystem:\n1\\. Error Detection Mechanisms:The Kernel I/O Subsystem incorporates various mechanisms to detect I/O errors promptly\n\n2\\. Error Reporting:Once an error is detected, the Kernel I/O Subsystem employs mechanisms to report the error to higher levels of the operating system or user applications\n\n3\\. Error Recovery Mechanisms:Recovering from I/O errors is crucial to maintaining system stability.\n\n4.User Notification:Informing users or administrators about I/O errors is essential for timely intervention and system maintenance:\n\n**User Alerts**: Providing alerts to users, either through the user interface or system notifications, can prompt immediate attention to potential issues.\n\n**Automated Notifications**: Implementing automated notification systems, such as emails or messages, to inform system administrators about critical errors for proactive system management.\n\n6. **I/O Protection \u2013**\n\nErrors and the issue of protection are closely related. A user process may attempt to issue illegal I/O instructions to disrupt the normal function of a system. We can use the various mechanisms to ensure that such disruption cannot take place in the system.\nTo prevent illegal I/O access, we define all I/O instructions to be privileged instructions. The user cannot issue I/O instruction directly.\n\n\n## **The Kernel I/O Subsystem in Operating System**\n\nAn Operating System (OS) is a complex software program that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer system. One of the critical components of an OS is the Kernel I/O Subsystem, which provides an interface between the operating system and input/output (I/O) devices. The Kernel I/O Subsystem manages the I/O requests made by the user applications and translates them into hardware commands that the devices can understand. In this article, we will discuss the importance of the Kernel I/O Subsystem and its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n## **Importance of Kernel I/O Subsystem**\n\nThe Kernel I/O Subsystem is an essential part of any modern [Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-operating-system/). It provides a unified and consistent interface to the I/O devices, which enables the user applications to access them without knowing the details of the underlying hardware. The Kernel I/O Subsystem also manages the [concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/) and [synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/) issues that arise when multiple applications try to access the same device simultaneously.\n\n### **Advantages of Kernel I/O Subsystem**\n\n- **Device Independence:** The Kernel I/O Subsystem provides device independence to the user applications. It abstracts the hardware details and provides a unified interface to the devices. This means that the application developers can write code that is independent of the hardware platform, and the Kernel I/O Subsystem takes care of the hardware-specific details.\n- **Efficient Resource Management:** The Kernel I/O Subsystem provides efficient resource management for the I/O devices. It manages the I/O requests and schedules them in a way that optimizes the usage of the available resources. This ensures that the I/O devices are not overutilized, and the system remains responsive.\n- **Concurrency Management:** The Kernel I/O Subsystem manages the concurrency issues that arise when multiple applications try to access the same device simultaneously. It ensures that the applications get exclusive access to the device when needed and allows multiple applications to share the device when appropriate.\n\n### **Disadvantages of Kernel I/O Subsystem**\n\n- **Complex Implementation:** The Kernel I/O Subsystem is a complex software component that requires a lot of resources to implement and maintain. Any issues with the Kernel I/O Subsystem can affect the performance and stability of the entire system.\n- **Security Risks:** The [Kernel I/O](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/) Subsystem can pose security risks to the system if not implemented correctly. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the Kernel I/O Subsystem to gain unauthorized access to the system or cause a denial-of-service attack.\n\n**Typical functions and services offered by the Kernel:**\n\n1. **Process management:** Save context of the interrupted program, dispatch a process, manipulate scheduling lists.\n2. **Process communication:** Send and receive interprocess messages.\n3. **Memory management:** Set memory protection information, swap-in/ swap-out, handle page fault.\n4. **I/O management:** Initiate I/O ,process I/O completion interrupt, recover from I/O errors.\n5. **File management:** Open a file, read/ write data.\n6. **Security and protection:** Add authentication information for a new user, maintain information for file protection.\n7. **Network management:** Send/ receive data through a message.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the Kernel I/O Subsystem is an essential component of any modern Operating System. It provides device independence, efficient resource management, and concurrency management to the I/O devices. However, it requires a lot of resources to implement and maintain, and any issues with the Kernel I/O Subsystem can affect the performance and stability of the entire system.
